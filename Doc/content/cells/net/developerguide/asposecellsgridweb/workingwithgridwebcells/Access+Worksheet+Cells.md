## Accessing Cells in a Worksheet

Each worksheet contains a property by the name of `Cells` that is actually a collection of `GridCell` objects where a `GridCell` object represents a cell in Aspose.Cells.GridWeb. It is possible to access any cell using Aspose.Cells.GridWeb. There are two preferred methods, each of which is discussed below.

### Using Cell Name

All cells have a unique name. For example, A1, A2, B1, B2 etc. Aspose.Cells.GridWeb allows developers to access any desired cell by using the cell name. Simply pass the cell name (as an index) to the `Cells` collection of the `GridWorksheet`.

### Using Row & Column Indices

A cell can also be recognized by its location in terms of row and column indices. Just pass a cell's row and column indices to the `Cells` collection of the `GridWorksheet`. This approach is more faster than the above one.
