Aspose.Cells for .NET : Evaluate Aspose.Cells  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Evaluate Aspose.Cells


You can easily download an Aspose.Cells evaluation from the [download page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspose.Cells) @ NuGet repos. The evaluation download is the same as the download for the full version: the evaluation becomes licensed when you apply a license.

The evaluation version of Aspose.Cells (that is, Aspose.Cells without a license applied) provides most of the product functionality. One limitation is that it always injects an extra worksheet with an evaluation watermark when a spreadsheet is opened or saved. The injected extra evaluation watermark worksheet to the workbook is shown below:

**Evaluation warning – an extra worksheet**


If you want to test Aspose.Cells without evaluation version limitations, [request a 30-day temporary license](http://www.aspose.com/corporate/purchase/faqs/temporary-license.aspx).
