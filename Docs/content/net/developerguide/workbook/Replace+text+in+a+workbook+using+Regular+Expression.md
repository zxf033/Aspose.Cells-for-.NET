# Replace text in a workbook using Regular Expression

Aspose.Cells provides the feature to replace text in a workbook using a regular expression. For this, the API provides [RegexKey](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/replaceoptions/properties/regexkey) property of the [ReplaceOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/replaceoptions) class. Setting the [RegexKey](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/replaceoptions/properties/regexkey) to **true** indicates that the searched key will be a regular expression.

The following code snippet demonstrates the use of the [RegexKey](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/replaceoptions/properties/regexkey) property by using the [sample excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/101122950/101089318.xlsx). The [output file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/101122950/101089319.xlsx) generated by the following code snippet is attached for reference.
