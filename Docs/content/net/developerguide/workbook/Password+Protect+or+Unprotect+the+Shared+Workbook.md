## Password Protect or Unprotect the Shared Workbook

The following sample code creates a workbook and protects it while enabling sharing and saves it as [output Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/54690001/55541777.xlsx). The screenshot shows that when you try to unprotect it, Microsoft Excel prompts you to enter the password to unprotect it.
