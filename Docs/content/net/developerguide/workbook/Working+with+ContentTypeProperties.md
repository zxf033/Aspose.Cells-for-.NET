# Working with ContentTypeProperties

Aspose.Cells provides [Workbook.ContentTypeProperties.Add](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.properties/contenttypepropertycollection/methods/add/index) method to add custom ContentTypeProperties to an excel file. You may also make the property optional by setting the [ContentTypeProperty.IsNillable](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.properties/contenttypeproperty/properties/isnillable) property to **true**. The following code snippet demonstrates adding optional custom ContentTypeProperties to an excel file. The following image shows both properties that were added by the sample code.
