## Possible Usage Scenarios

When you save your Excel file into HTML, comments are not exported. However, Aspose.Cells provides this feature using the [HtmlSaveOptions.IsExportComments](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions/properties/isexportcomments) property. If you set it **true**, then HTML will also display comments present in your Excel file.

## Export Comments while Saving Excel file to Html

The following sample code explains the usage of [HtmlSaveOptions.IsExportComments](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions/properties/isexportcomments) property. The screenshot shows the effect of the code on the HTML when it is set to **true**. Please download the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/50266169/50528260.xlsx) and the [generated HTML](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/50266169/50528261.html) for a reference.
