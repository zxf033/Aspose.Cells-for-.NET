Aspose.Cells for .NET : Set column width to scalable unit like em or percent  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Set column width to scalable unit like em or percent


Generating an HTML file from a spreadsheet is very common. The size of the columns is defined in "pt" which works in many cases. However, there can be a case where this fixed size may not be required. For example, if a container panel width is 600px where this HTML page is being displayed. In this case, you may get a horizontal scrollbar if the generated table width is bigger. It was required that this fixed size shall be changed into a scalable unit like em or percent to get a better presentation. Following sample code can be used where [HtmlSaveOptions.WidthScalable](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/htmlsaveoptions/properties/widthscalable) is set to **true** for creating scalable width.
