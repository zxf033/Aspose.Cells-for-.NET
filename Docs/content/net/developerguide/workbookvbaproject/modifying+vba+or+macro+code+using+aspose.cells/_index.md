# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Modifying VBA or Macro Code using Aspose.Cells


You can modify VBA or Macro Code using Aspose.Cells. Aspose.Cells has added the following namespace and classes to read and modify the VBA project in the Excel file.

*   Aspose.Cells.Vba
*   VbaProject
*   VbaModuleCollection
*   VbaModule

This article will show you how to change the VBA or Macro Code inside the source Excel file using Aspose.Cells.

The following sample code loads the source Excel file which has a following VBA or Macro code inside it

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
Sub Button1_Click()
    MsgBox "This is test message."
End Sub
{{< /code >}}

After the execution of Aspose.Cells sample code, the VBA or Macro code will be modified like this

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
Sub Button1_Click()
    MsgBox "This is Aspose.Cells message."
End Sub
{{< /code >}}
