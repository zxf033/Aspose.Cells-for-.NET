Aspose.Cells for .NET : Check if Digital Signature of VBA Code is Valid  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Check if Digital Signature of VBA Code is Valid


Aspose.Cells allows you to check if the digital signature of the VBA code is valid using the [Workbook.VbaProject.IsValidSigned](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.vba/vbaproject/properties/isvalidsigned) property. It will return **true** if the signature is valid otherwise it will return **false**. The digital signature of the VBA code becomes invalid when you change the VBA code.

The following code demonstrates the usage of this property using the [sample excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5018836/5115030.xlsm) which you can download from the provided link. The same excel file has a valid signature but when we modify its VBA code and save the workbook and then recheck, we find its signature has become invalid.
