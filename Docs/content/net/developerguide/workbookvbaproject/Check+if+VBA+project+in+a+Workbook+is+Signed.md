Aspose.Cells for .NET : Check if VBA project in a Workbook is Signed  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Check if VBA project in a Workbook is Signed


You can check if your VBA project is signed or not using Microsoft Excel via **Tools > Digital Signatures...** menu command. Similarly, you can check it programmatically using Aspose.Cells [Workbook.VbaProject.IsSigned](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.vba/vbaproject/properties/issigned) property.

The following code loads the workbook and checks if its VBA project is signed using [Workbook.VbaProject.IsSigned](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.vba/vbaproject/properties/issigned)Â property. The property will return **true** if the project is signed otherwise it will return **false**.
