## Possible Usage Scenarios

Aspose.Cells allows you to set the margins of any shape or comment using the [Shape.TextBody.TextAlignmen](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/fontsettingcollection/properties/textalignment)t property. This property returns the object of [Aspose.Cells.Drawing.Texts.ShapeTextAlignment](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment) class which has different properties e.g. [TopMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/topmarginpt), [LeftMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/leftmarginpt), [BottomMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/bottommarginpt), [RightMarginPt](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.texts/shapetextalignment/properties/rightmarginpt), etc. that can be used to set the top, left, bottom and right margins.

## Set Margins of Comment or Shape inside the Worksheet

Please see the following sample code. It loads the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/61542248/61767851.xlsx) that contains two shapes. The code accesses the shapes one by one and sets their top, left, bottom and right margins. Please see the [output Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/61542248/61767852.xlsx) generated by the code and screenshot showing the effect of the code on the output Excel file.
