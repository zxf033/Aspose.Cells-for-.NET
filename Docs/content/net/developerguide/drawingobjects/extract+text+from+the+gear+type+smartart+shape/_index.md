## Possible Usage Scenarios

Aspose.Cells can extract text from the `Gear Type Smart Art Shape`. In order to do so, you should first convert `Smart Art Shape` to `Group Shape` using the [Shape.GetResultOfSmartArt()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/methods/getresultofsmartart) method. Then you should get the array of all the `Individual Shapes` forming the Group Shape using the [GroupShape.GetGroupedShapes()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/groupshape/methods/getgroupedshapes) method. Finally, you can iterate all of the Individual Shapes one by one in a loop and extract their text using the [Shape.Text](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/text) property.

## Extract Text from the Gear Type SmartArt Shape

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/66948394/67338483.xlsx) that contains `Gear Type Smart Art Shape`. It then extracts the text from its individual shapes as discussed above. Please see the console output of the code given below for a reference.
