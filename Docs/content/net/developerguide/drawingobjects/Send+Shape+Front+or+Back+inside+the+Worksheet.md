## Possible Usage Scenarios

When there are multiple shapes present in the same location then how will they be visible is decided by their z-order positions. Aspose.Cells provides [Shape.ToFrontOrBack()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/methods/tofrontorback) method which changes the z-order position of the shape. If you want to send shape to back you will use a negative number like -1, -2, -3, etc. and if you want to send shape to the front, you will use a positive number like 1, 2, 3, etc.

## Send Shape Front or Back inside the Worksheet

The following sample code explains the usage of [Shape.ToFrontOrBack()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/methods/tofrontorback) method. Please see the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/50270201/50528330.xlsx) used inside the code and the [output Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/50270201/50528331.xlsx) generated by it.
