## Possible Usage Scenarios

You can convert Smart Art Shape into Group Shape using the [Shape.GetResultOfSmartArt()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/methods/getresultofsmartart) method. It will enable you to handle smart art shape like a group shape. Consequently, you will have access to the individual parts or shapes of the group shape.

## Convert the Smart Art to Group Shape

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/54690186/55541793.xlsx) containing a smart art shape as shown in this screenshot. It then converts the smart art shape into group shape and prints the Shape.IsGroup property. Please see the console output of the sample code given below.
