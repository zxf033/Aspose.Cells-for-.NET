## Introduction

Developers can add different drawing objects such as text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, combo boxes, labels, buttons, lines, rectangles, arcs, ovals, spinners, scroll bars, group boxes etc. Aspose.Cells provides the `Aspose.Cells.Drawing` namespace which contains all the drawing objects. However, there are a few drawing objects or shapes that are not supported yet. Create these drawing objects in a designer spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel and then import the designer spreadsheet to Aspose.Cells. Aspose.Cells allows you to load these drawing objects from a designer spreadsheet and write them to a generated file.

## Adding Text Box Control to a Worksheet

One way to stress important information in a report is to use a text box. For example, add text to highlight the company name or to indicate the geographic region with the highest sales etc. Aspose.Cells provides the `TextBoxCollection` class, used to add a new text box to the collection. There is another class, `TextBox`, which represents a text box used to define all types of settings. It has some important members:

*   The `TextFrame` property returns a `MsoTextFrame` object used to adjust the contents of the text box.
*   The `Placement` property specifies the placement type.
*   The `Font` property specifies the font attributes.
*   The `AddHyperlink` method adds a hyperlink for the text box.
*   The `FillFormat` property returns an `MsoFillFormat` object used to set the fill format for the text box.
*   The `LineFormat` property returns the `MsoLineFormat` object usually used to style and weight of the text box line.
*   The `Text` property specifies the input text for the text box.

The following example creates two textboxes in the first worksheet of the workbook. The first text box is well-furnished with differnt format settings. The second is a simple one.

## Manipulating Text Box Controls in Designer Spreadsheets

Aspose.Cells also lets you access textboxes in the desinger worksheets and manipulate them. Use the `Worksheet.TextBoxes` property to get the textboxes collection in the sheet.

The following example uses the Microsoft Excel file that we created in the above example. It gets the text strings of the two textboxes and changes the text of the second textbox to save the file.

## Adding Check Box Control to a Worksheet

Check boxes are handy if you want to provide a way for a user to choose between two options, such as true or false; yes or no. Aspose.Cells allows you to use check boxes in worksheets. For instance, you may have developed a financial projection worksheet in which you can either account for a particular acquisition or not. In this case, you might want to place a check box at the top of the worksheet. You can then link the status of this check box to another cell, so that if the check box is selected, the value of the cell is True; if it is not selected, the value of the cell is False.

### Using Microsoft Excel

To place a check box control in your worksheet, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure the Forms toolbar is displayed.
2.  Click the **Check Box** tool on the Forms toolbar.
3.  In your worksheet area, click and drag to define the rectangle that will hold the check box and the label beside the check box.
4.  Once the check box is placed, move the mouse cursor into the label area and change the label.
5.  In the **Cell Link** field, specify the address of the cell to which this check box should be linked.
6.  Click on **OK**.

### Using Aspose.Cells

Aspose.Cells provides the `CheckBoxCollection` class, which is used to add a new check box to the collection. There is another class, `Aspose.Cells.Drawing.CheckBox`, which represents a check box. It has some important members:

*   The `LinkedCell` property specifies a cell which is linked to the check box.
*   The `Text` property specifies the text string associated with the check box. It is the label of the check box.
*   The `Value` property specifies if the check box is checked or not.

The following example shows how to add a checkbox to the worksheet.

## Adding Radio Button Control to the Worksheet

A radio button, or an option button, is a control made of a round box. The user makes his or her decision by selecting the round box. A radio button is usually, if not always, accompanied by others. Such radio buttons appear and behave as a group. The user decides which button is valid by selecting only one of them. When the user clicks one button, it is filled. When one button in the group is selected, buttons of the same group are empty.

### Using Microsoft Excel

To place a Radio Button control in your worksheet, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure the **Forms** toolbar is displayed.
2.  Click the **Option Button** tool.
3.  In the worksheet, click and drag to define the rectangle that will hold the option button and the label beside the option button.
4.  Once the radio button is placed in the worksheet, move the mouse cursor into the label area and change the label.
5.  In the **Cell Link** field, specify the address of the cell to which this radio button should be linked.
6.  Click **OK**.

### Using Aspose.Cells

*   The {{PageChange}} property specifies how much the current value will be incremented if you click inside the scroll bar on either side of the scroll box.

The following example shows how to add a scroll bar to the worksheet.

## Adding GroupBox Control to Group Controls in a Worksheet

Sometimes you do need to implement radio buttons or other controls which belong to a certain group, you can implement by including either a group box or rectangle control. Any of these two objects would serve as the delimiter of the group. After adding one of these shapes, you can then add two or more radio buttons or other group objects.

### Using Microsoft Excel

To place a group box control in your worksheet and place controls in it:

*   To start a form, on the main menu, click \*View\*, followed by \*Toolbars\* and \*Forms\*.
*   On the \*Forms\* toolbar, click the \*Group Box\* and draw a rectangle on the worksheet.
*   Type a caption string for the box.
*   On the \*Forms\* toolbar, click \*Option Button\* and click inside the \*Group Box\* just under the caption string.
*   From the \*Forms\* toolbar again, click \*Option Button\* and click inside the \*Group Box\* under the first radio button.
*   Once again on the \*Forms\* toolbar, click \*Option Button\* and click inside the \*Group Box\* under the previous radio button.

### Using Aspose.Cells

The {{Aspose.Cells.Drawing.ShapeCollection}} class provides a method named {{AddGroupBox}}, which is used to add a group box control to the worksheet. The method returns an {{Aspose.Cells.Drawing.GroupBox}} object.
