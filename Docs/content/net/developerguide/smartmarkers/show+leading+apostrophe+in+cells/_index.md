# Show leading apostrophe in cells

In Microsoft Excel, the leading apostrophe in the cell's value is hidden. Aspose.Cells provides the feature to display the apostrophe by default. For this, the API provides [Workbook.Settings.QuotePrefixToStyle](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/properties/quoteprefixtostyle) property. This property indicates whether to set the [QuotePrefix](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/style/properties/quoteprefix) property when entering string value starting with a single quote to the cell. Setting the [Workbook.Settings.QuotePrefixToStyle](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/properties/quoteprefixtostyle) property to **false **will display the leading apostrophe in the output excel file.

The following screenshot shows the output excel file with the visible apostrophe.
