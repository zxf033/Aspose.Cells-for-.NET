## Possible Usage Scenarios

GridWeb now supports users to enter cell data in percentage format like 3% and the data in the cell will automatically be formatted as 3.00%. However, you will have to set the cell style to `Percentage Format` which is either `GridTableItemStyle.NumberType` a 9 or 10. The number 9 will format 3% as 3% but the number 10 will format 3% as 3.00%.

If you have not set the cell style to `Percentage Format`, then input data 3% will display as 0.03.
