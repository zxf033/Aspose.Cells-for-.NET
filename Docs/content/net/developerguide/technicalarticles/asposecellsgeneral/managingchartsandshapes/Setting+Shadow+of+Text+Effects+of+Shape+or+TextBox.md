Aspose.Cells for .NET : Setting Shadow of Text Effects of Shape or TextBox  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Setting Shadow of Text Effects of Shape or TextBox


You can set the **Shadow** of **Text Effects** of any Shape or TextBox. Please use the [Shape.TextBody](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/textbody) property. It presents the setting of the shape's text and returns [FontSetting](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/fontsetting) objects. After accessing it, please set the **Shadow** via [FontSetting.TextOptions.Shadow.PresetType.PresetType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/properties/presettype) property. This property is of the type [PresetShadowType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/presetshadowtype) which has several values. Some of these are

*   OffsetDiagonalBottomRight
*   OffsetBottom
*   OffsetDiagonalTopRight
*   InsideLeft
*   InsideCenter
*   PerspectiveDiagonalUpperLeft
*   PerspectiveDiagonalLowerRight

The following code snippet demonstrates the use of [FontSetting.TextOptions.Shadow.PresetType.PresetType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shadoweffect/properties/presettype) property to set shadow of text effects of Shape or TextBox.
