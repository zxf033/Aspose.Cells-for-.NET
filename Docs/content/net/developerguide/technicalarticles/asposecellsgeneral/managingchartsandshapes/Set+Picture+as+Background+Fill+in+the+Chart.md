Aspose.Cells for .NET : Set Picture as Background Fill in the Chart  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Set Picture as Background Fill in the Chart


Aspose.Cells allows you to set a gradient, texture, pattern or picture as fill effects for different objects, such as the plot area, chart area, or legend box of a chart. This document shows how to add an image to a chart's background.

To achieve this, Aspose.Cells provides the [Chart.PlotArea.Area.FillFormat.ImageData](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/fillformat/properties/imagedata) property. The following code sample demonstrates the use of [Chart.PlotArea.Area.FillFormat.ImageData](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/fillformat/properties/imagedata) property to set a picture as a background fill in the chart.
