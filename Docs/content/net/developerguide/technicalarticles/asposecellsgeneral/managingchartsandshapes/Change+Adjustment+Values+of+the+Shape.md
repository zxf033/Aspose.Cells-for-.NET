# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Change Adjustment Values of the Shape


Aspose.Cells provides [Shape.Geometry.ShapeAdjustValues](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/geometry/properties/shapeadjustvalues) property to make changes to the adjustment points with shapes. In the Microsoft Excel UI, adjustments display as yellow diamond nodes. For example:

*   Rounded Rectangle has an adjustment to change the arc
*   Triangle has an adjustment to change the location of the point
*   Trapezoid has an adjustment to change the width of the top
*   Arrows have two adjustments to change the shape of the head and tail

This article will explain the use of [Shape.Geometry.ShapeAdjustValues](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/geometry/properties/shapeadjustvalues) property to change the adjustment value of the different shapes.

The below code sample shows how to change adjustment values of the shape.
