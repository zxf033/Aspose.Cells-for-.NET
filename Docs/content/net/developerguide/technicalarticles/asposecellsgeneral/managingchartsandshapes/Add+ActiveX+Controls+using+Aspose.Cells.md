Aspose.Cells for .NET : Add ActiveX Controls using Aspose.Cells  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Add ActiveX Controls using Aspose.Cells


You can add ActiveX controls with Aspose.Cells using the [ShapeCollection.AddActiveXControl()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shapecollection/methods/addactivexcontrol) method. This method takes a parameter [ControlType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing.activexcontrols/controltype)Â which tells what type of ActiveX control needs to be added inside a worksheet. It has the following values.

*   ControlType.CheckBox
*   ControlType.ComboBox
*   ControlType.CommandButton
*   ControlType.Image
*   ControlType.Label
*   ControlType.ListBox
*   ControlType.RadioButton
*   ControlType.ScrollBar
*   ControlType.SpinButton
*   ControlType.TextBox
*   ControlType.ToggleButton
*   ControlType.Unknown

Once, you have added the ActiveX control inside the shape collection, you can then access the ActiveX control object via [Shape.ActiveXControl](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/activexcontrol) property and then set its various properties.

The following sample code adds Toggle Button ActiveX Control using Aspose.Cells.
