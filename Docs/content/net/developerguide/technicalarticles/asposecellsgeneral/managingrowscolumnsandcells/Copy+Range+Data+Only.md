Aspose.Cells for .NET : Copy Range Data Only  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Copy Range Data Only


Sometimes, you need to copy data from one range of cells to another, copying the data only, not the formatting. Aspose.Cells offers this feature.

This article provides a sample code that uses Aspose.Cells to copy a range of data.

This example shows how to:

1.  Create a workbook.
2.  Add data to cells in the first worksheet.
3.  Create a [Range](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/range).
4.  Create a [Style](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/style) object with specified formatting attributes.
5.  Apply the style formatting to the range.
6.  Create another range of cells.
7.  Copy data of the first range to this second range.
