Aspose.Cells for .NET : Merge or Unmerge Range of Cells  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Merge or Unmerge Range of Cells


You can use Aspose.Cells to merge or split a range of cells. Aspose.Cells provides the [Range.Merge()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/range/methods/merge) and [Range.UnMerge()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/range/methods/unmerge) methods for this purpose. This article explains how to merge a range of cells into a single cell.

## Example

The following sample code first creates a range - A1:D4 - then merges the cells in the range into a single cell using the [Range.Merge()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/range/methods/merge) method. Similarly, you can split cells by creating a range and calling the [Range.UnMerge()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/range/methods/unmerge) method.
