Aspose.Cells for .NET : Find if the cell value starts with single quote mark  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Find if the cell value starts with single quote mark


Aspose.Cells now provides the [Style.QuotePrefix](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/style/properties/quoteprefix) property to find if the cell value starts with a single quote mark. Before this property, there was no way to distinguish between strings like `sample` and `'sample` etc.

The following sample code explains that the strings like `sample` and `'sample` cannot be differentiated with [Cell.StringValue](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/cell/properties/stringvalue) property. Therefore we must use [Style.QuotePrefix](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/style/properties/quoteprefix) property to distinguish them.
