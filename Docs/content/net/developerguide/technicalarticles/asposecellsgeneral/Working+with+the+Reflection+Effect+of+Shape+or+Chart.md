## Possible Usage Scenarios

Aspose.Cells provides the [Shape.Reflection](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/reflection) property along with [ReflectionEffect](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect) class to work with the reflection effect of shape or chart. The [ReflectionEffect](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect) class contains the following properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.

*   [Blur](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/blur)
*   [Direction](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/direction)
*   [Distance](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/distance)
*   [FadeDirection](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/fadedirection)
*   [RotWithShape](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/rotwithshape)
*   [Size](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/size)
*   [Transparency](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/transparency)
*   [Type](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/properties/type)

## Working with the Reflection Effect of Shape or Chart

The following sample code loads the [source excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013635/5115424.xlsx) and accesses the first shape in the default worksheet and sets different properties of [Shape.Reflection](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/reflection) class and then saves the workbook in the [output excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013635/5115423.xlsx).
