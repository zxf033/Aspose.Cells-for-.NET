Aspose.Cells for .NET : Find Cells with Specific Style  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Find Cells with Specific Style


Sometimes, you need to find cells with a particular style applied. You can use Aspose.Cells to find all cells with a common style. Aspose.Cells provides the [FindOptions.Style](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/findoptions/properties/style) property which you can use to specify the style to search cells for.

The code in this example finds all cells that have the same style as that of cell A1. After the code has been executed, all the cells that have the same style as A1 contain the text "Found".
