# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Excel to HTML - Use PresentationPreference Option for Better Layout


Aspose.Cells provides a useful `HtmlSaveOptions.PresentationPreference` property for developers who need to render better layout when saving a Microsoft Excel file to HTML or MHT format. The default value of the property is false. We recommend setting this property to true to get a more attractive presentation of Excel reports.

Please see the sample code below that demonstrates how to render an HTML file from Excel report with presentation preference on.
