# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Specify whether the PivotTable is compatible for Excel2003 while refreshing PivotTable


Aspose.Cells provides the `PivotTable.IsExcel2003Compatible` property which you can use to specify whether the PivotTable is compatible for Excel2003 while refreshing PivotTable. If true, a string must be less than or equal to 255 characters, so if the string is greater than 255 characters, it will be truncated. If false, a string will not have the aforementioned restriction. The default value is true.

## Specify whether the PivotTable is compatible for Excel2003 while refreshing PivotTable

The following sample code explains the usage of `PivotTable.IsExcel2003Compatible` property. The original string is 383 characters long. But when `PivotTable.IsExcel2003Compatible` property is set true and pivot table is refreshed, the data of cell B5 of the pivot table is truncated and it becomes 255 characters long. However, when `PivotTable.IsExcel2003Compatible` property is set false and pivot table is again refreshed, the data of cell B5 of the pivot table is not truncated and remains 383 characters long.
