Aspose.Cells for .NET : Using WorkbookMetadata  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Using WorkbookMetadata


Aspose.Cells allows you to load a light-weight version of workbook into memory to edit its metadata information. Please use the [WorkbookMetadata](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.metadata/workbookmetadata) class to load the workbook.

The following sample code uses [WorkbookMetadata](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.metadata/workbookmetadata) class to edit custom document properties of a workbook. Once you open the workbook using [Workbook](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/workbook) class, you will be able to read the document properties. Here is a sample code using the [WorkbookMetadata](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.metadata/workbookmetadata) class.
