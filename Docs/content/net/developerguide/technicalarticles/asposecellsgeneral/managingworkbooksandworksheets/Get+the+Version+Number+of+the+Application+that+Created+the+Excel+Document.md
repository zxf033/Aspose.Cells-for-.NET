# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Get the Version Number of the Application that Created the Excel Document


Often you need to know the version number of the application that created a Microsoft Excel document. Aspose.Cells provides the [Workbook.BuiltInDocumentProperties.Version](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.properties/builtindocumentpropertycollection/properties/version) property for this purpose.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of the [Workbook.BuiltInDocumentProperties.Version](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.properties/builtindocumentpropertycollection/properties/version)Â property. It loads Excel files created with Microsoft Excel 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013 and prints the version number of the application that created these Excel documents.
