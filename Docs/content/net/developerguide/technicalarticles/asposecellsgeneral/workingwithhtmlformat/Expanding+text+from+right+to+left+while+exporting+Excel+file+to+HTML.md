Aspose.Cells for .NET : Expanding text from right to left while exporting Excel file to HTML  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Expanding text from right to left while exporting Excel file to HTML


Aspose.Cells now supports expanding text from right to left while exporting Excel file to HTML. This feature has been implemented since the v8.9.0.0. Now if your source excel file contains any text which expands from right to left, then Aspose.Cells will export it to HTML correctly.
