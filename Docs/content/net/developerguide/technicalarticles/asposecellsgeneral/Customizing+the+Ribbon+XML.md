Aspose.Cells for .NET : Customizing the Ribbon XML  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Customizing the Ribbon XML


Microsoft Office 2007/2010 replaced menus and toolbars with a Ribbon at the top of the application window. The Ribbon is customizable.  
Aspose.Cells allows you to

*   Keep Ribbon XML without parsing it,
*   Read and write Ribbon XML without parsing it,
*   Get and set Ribbon XML data.

If you want to change the Ribbon XML, you have to parse it with an XML parser or other Ribbon XML tool.
