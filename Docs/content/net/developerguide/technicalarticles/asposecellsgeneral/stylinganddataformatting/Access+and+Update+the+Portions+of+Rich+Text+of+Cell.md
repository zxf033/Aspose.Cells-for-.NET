# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Access and Update the Portions of Rich Text of Cell


Aspose.Cells allows you to access and update the portions of the rich text of the cell. For this purpose, you can use [Cell.GetCharacters()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/cell/methods/getcharacters/index) and [Cell.SetCharacters()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/cell/methods/setcharacters) methods. These methods will return and accept the array of [FontSetting](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/fontsetting) objects which you can use to access and update various properties of font like font name, font color, boldness, etc.
