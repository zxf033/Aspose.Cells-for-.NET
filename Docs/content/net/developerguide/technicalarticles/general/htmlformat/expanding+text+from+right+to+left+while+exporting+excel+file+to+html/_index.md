# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Expanding text from right to left while exporting Excel file to HTML


Aspose.Cells now supports expanding text from right to left while exporting Excel file to HTML. This feature has been implemented since the v8.9.0.0. Now if your source excel file contains any text which expands from right to left, then Aspose.Cells will export it to HTML correctly.

The following sample code converts the [sample excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5024960/5115502.xlsx) into HTML. This screenshot shows how the sample excel looks like in Microsoft Excel 2013.
