# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Set Background Picture for a Worksheet


You can make a worksheet more appealing by adding a picture as a worksheet background. This feature can be quite effective if you have a special corporate graphic that adds a hint of background without obscuring the data on the sheet. You can set background picture for a sheet using Aspose.Cells API.
