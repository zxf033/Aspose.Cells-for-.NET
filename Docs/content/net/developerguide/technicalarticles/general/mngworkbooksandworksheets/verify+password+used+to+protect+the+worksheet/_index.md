# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Verify Password Used to Protect the Worksheet


Aspose.Cells APIs have enhanced the [Protection](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/protection) class by introducing some useful properties & methods. One such method is the [VerifyPassword](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/protection/methods/verifypassword) which allows specifying a password as an instance of *string *and verifies if the same password has been used to protect the [Worksheet](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/worksheet).

The [Protection.VerifyPassword](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/protection/methods/verifypassword) method returns **true **if the specified password matches the password used to protect the given worksheet and **false **if the specified password does not match. Following piece of code uses the [Protection.VerifyPassword](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/protection/methods/verifypassword) method in conjunction with [Protection.IsProtectedWithPassword](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/protection/properties/isprotectedwithpassword) property to detect the password protection, and verifies the password.
