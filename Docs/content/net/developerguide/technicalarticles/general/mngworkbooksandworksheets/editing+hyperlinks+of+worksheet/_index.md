# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Editing Hyperlinks of Worksheet


Aspose.Cells allows you to access all the hyperlinks of the worksheet using the [Worksheet.Hyperlinks](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/worksheet/properties/hyperlinks) collection. You can access each hyperlink from this collection one by one and edit its properties.

The following sample code accesses all the hyperlinks of the worksheet and changes their [Hyperlink.Address](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/hyperlink/properties/address)Â property to the Aspose website.
