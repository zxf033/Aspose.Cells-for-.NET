# Aspose.Cells for .NET : How to Detect a File Format and Check if the File is Encrypted


Sometimes you need to detect a file's format before opening it because the file extension does not guarantee that the file content is appropriate. The file might be encrypted (a password-protected file) so it can't be read it directly, or we should not read it. Aspose.Cells provides the [FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/fileformatutil/methods/detectfileformat/index) static method and some relevant APIs that you can use to process documents.

The following sample code illustrates how to detect a file format (using the file path) and check its extension. You can also determine whether the file is encrypted.
