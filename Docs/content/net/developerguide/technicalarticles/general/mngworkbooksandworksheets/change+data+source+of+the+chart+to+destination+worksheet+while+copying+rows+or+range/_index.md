## Possible Usage Scenarios

When you copy rows or range which contains charts to a new worksheet, then the data source of the chart does not change. For example, if the data source of chart is `=Sheet1!$A$1:$B$4`, then after copying rows or range to new worksheet, the data source will remain the same i.e `=Sheet1!$A$1:$B$4`. It still refers to old worksheet i.e. `Sheet1`. This is also the behavior in Microsoft Excel. But if you want that it to refer to the new destination worksheet, then please use the [CopyOptions.ReferToDestinationSheet](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/copyoptions/properties/refertodestinationsheet) property and set it to **true **while calling the [Cells.CopyRows()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/cells/methods/copyrows/index) method. Now if your destination worksheet is `DestSheet`, then the data source of your chart will change from `=Sheet1!$A$1:$B$4` to `=DestSheet!$A$1:$B$4`.

## Change Data Source of the Chart to Destination Worksheet while Copying Rows or Range

The following sample code explains the usage of [CopyOptions.ReferToDestinationSheet](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/copyoptions/properties/refertodestinationsheet) property while copying rows or range containing charts to a new worksheet. The code uses the [sample excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013542/5113699.xlsx) and generates the [output excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013542/5113697.xlsx).
