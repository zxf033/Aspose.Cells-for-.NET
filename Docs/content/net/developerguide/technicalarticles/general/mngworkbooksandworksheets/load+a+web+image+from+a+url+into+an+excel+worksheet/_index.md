# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Load a Web Image from a URL into an Excel Worksheet


[Insert a Linked Picture from Web Address](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/technicalarticles/general/mngworkbooksandworksheets/insert+a+linked+picture+from+web+address) explained how to insert an image from the web into a spreadsheet. As well as linking to the image, you can extract and download the image data into a stream and then insert the image from the stream into the worksheet with Aspose.Cells. This adds the image to the spreadsheet's image collection whereas the other method loads the image from the web each time the spreadsheet is opened.
