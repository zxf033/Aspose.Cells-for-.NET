## Possible Usage Scenarios

Aspose.Cells provides the [Shape.ThreeDFormat](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/threedformat) property along with [ThreeDFormat](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat) class to work with the `3-D Format` of shape or chart. The [ThreeDFormat](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat) class contains different properties which can be set to achieve different results as per application requirements.

## Working with the ThreeDFormat of Shape or Chart

The following sample code loads the [source excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013731/5115419.xlsx) and accesses the first shape in the first worksheet and sets the sub-properties of [Shape.ThreeDFormat](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/threedformat) property and then saves the workbook in the [output excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013731/5115410.xlsx).
