## Saving Worksheets to Images - Different Approaches

Sometimes, you might require presenting your worksheets as a pictorial representation. You do need to present the worksheet images into your applications or web pages. You might need to insert the images into a Word document, a PDF file, a PowerPoint presentation or use them in some other scenario. Simply you want a worksheet rendered as an image, so that you can use it elsewhere. Aspose.Cells supports converting worksheets in Excel files to images. Also, Aspose.Cells supports setting different options like image format, resolution (both vertical and horizontal), image quality and other image and print options.

You might try `Office Automation` but Office automation has its own drawbacks. There are several reasons and issues involved: for example, security, stability, scalability and speed, price, and features. In Short, there are many reasons, with the top one being that Microsoft themselves strongly recommends against Office automation from software solutions.

This article shows how to create a console application in Visual Studio .NET, perform the conversion of worksheet to image using different image and print options with a few and simplest lines of code using Aspose.Cells API.

You need to import `Aspose.Cells.Rendering` namespace to your program/project. It has several valuable classes, for example `SheetRender`, `ImageOrPrintOptions`, `WorkbookRender` etc.

The `Aspose.Cells.Rendering.SheetRender` class represents a worksheet to render images for the worksheet, it has an overloaded `ToImage` method that can directly convert a worksheet to image file(s) specified with your desired attributes or options. It can return `System.Drawing.Bitmap` object and you can `Save` an image file to the disk/stream. There are several image formats supported, e.g BMP, PNG, GIFF, JPEG, TIFF, EMF and so on.

## Using Aspose.Cells to Convert Worksheet to Image using ImageOrPrint options.

### Creating a template workbook in Microsoft Excel

I created a new workbook in MS Excel and added some data in the first worksheet. Now, I will convert the template file’s worksheet “Sheet1” to an image file “SheetImage.tiff” and will apply different image options like horizontal and vertical resolutions, TiffCompression etc.

### Download and Install Aspose.Cells

First, you need to [download](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/51/.net-components/aspose.cells-for-.net/default.aspx) Aspose.Cells for .Net. Install it on your development computer. All [Aspose](http://www.aspose.com/) components, when installed, work in evaluation mode. The evaluation mode has no time limit and it only injects watermarks into produced documents.

### Create a Project

Start Visual Studio. Net and create a new console application. This example will show a C# console application, but you can use VB.NET too.

### Add References

This project will use Aspose.Cells . So, you have to add reference to Aspose.Cells component in your project. For example, add a reference to ….\\Program Files\\Aspose\\Aspose.Cells for .NET\\Bin\\Net1.0\\Aspose.Cells.dll

### Convert Worksheet to Image file

## Conversion Options

It is possible to save specific pages to image. The following code converts the first and second worksheets in a workbook to JPG images.

## Image conversion using `WorkbookRender`

You can cycle through the workbook and render each worksheet in it to a separate image:
