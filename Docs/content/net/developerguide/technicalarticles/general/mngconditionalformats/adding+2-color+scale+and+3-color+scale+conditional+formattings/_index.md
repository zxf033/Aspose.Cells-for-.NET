# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Adding 2-Color Scale and 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings


**2-Color Scale** and **3-Color Scale** Conditional Formattings are added in the same way except they are differed by [FormatCondition.ColorScale.Is3ColorScale](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/colorscale/properties/is3colorscale) property. This property is **false** for 2-Color Scale and **true** for 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings.

The following sample code adds 2-Color and 3-Color Scale Conditional Formattings. It generates the [output excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5018372/5115058.xlsx).
