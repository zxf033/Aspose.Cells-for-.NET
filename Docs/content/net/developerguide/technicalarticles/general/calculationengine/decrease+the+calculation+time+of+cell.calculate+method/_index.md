## Possible Usage Scenarios

Normally, we recommend users to call [Workbook.CalculateFormula()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/workbook/methods/calculateformula/index) method once and then get the calculated values of the individual cells. But sometimes, users do not want to calculate entire workbook. They just want to calculate a single cell. Aspose.Cells provides [CalculationOptions.Recursive](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/calculationoptions/properties/recursive) property which you can set to **false **and it will decrease the calculation time of individual cell significantly. Because when the recursive property is set to **true**, then all the dependents of cells are recalculated on each call. But when the recursive property is **false**, then dependent cells are calculated only once and are not calculated again on subsequent calls.

## Decrease the Calculation Time of Cell.Calculate() method

The following sample code illustrates the usage of [CalculationOptions.Recursive](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/calculationoptions/properties/recursive) property. Please execute this code with the given [sample excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013541/5113710.xlsx) and check its console output. You will find that setting the recursive property to **false **has decreased the calculation time significantly. Please also read the comments for a better understanding of this property.

## Console Output

This is the console output of the above sample code when executed with the given [sample excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013541/5113710.xlsx) on our machine. Please note, your output may differ but the elapsed time after setting the recursive property to **false **will always be less than setting it to **true**.
