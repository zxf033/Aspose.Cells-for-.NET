# Aspose.Cells for .NET : AutoFit Rows for Merged Cells


Microsoft Excel provides a feature that allows you to auto-size the height of a cell according to its content. The feature is called auto-fit rows. Microsoft Excel doesn't set auto-fit operation on merged cells natively. Sometimes the feature becomes vital for a user who really needs to implement auto-fit rows on merged cells too.

Aspose.Cells supports this feature through the [AutoFitterOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/autofitteroptions)Â API. Using this API, it is possible to auto-fit rows in a worksheet including merged cells.
