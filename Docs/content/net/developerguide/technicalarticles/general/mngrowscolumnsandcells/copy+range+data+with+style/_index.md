# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Copy Range Data with Style


[Copy Range Data Only](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/technicalarticles/general/mngrowscolumnsandcells/copy+range+data+only) explained how to copy the data from a range of cells to another range. Specifically, it process applied a new set of styles to the copied cells. Aspose.Cells can also copy a range complete with formatting. This article explains how.

Aspose.Cells provides a range of classes and methods for working with ranges, for example, [CreateRange()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/cells/methods/createrange/index), [StyleFlag](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/styleflag) and [ApplyStyle()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/cells/methods/applystyle).

This example:

1.  Creates a workbook.
2.  Fills a number of cells in the first worksheet with data.
3.  Creates a [Range](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/range).
4.  Creates a [Style](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/style) object with specified formatting attributes.
5.  Applies the style to the data range.
6.  Creates a second range of cells.
7.  Copies data with the formatting from the first range to the second range.
