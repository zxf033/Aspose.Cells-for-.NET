# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Add a Picture to an Excel Comment


Microsoft Excel lets users customize the look and feel of spreadsheets to a great extent. It is even possible to add background pictures to comments.

Comments are added to cells to record comments, anything from the details of how a formula is worked, where a value comes from or questions from reviewers. Adding a background image can be an aesthetic choice, or be used to strengthen branding.
