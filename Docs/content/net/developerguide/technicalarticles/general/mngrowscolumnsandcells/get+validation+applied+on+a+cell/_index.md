# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Get Validation Applied on a Cell


You can use Aspose.Cells to get the validation applied to a cell. Aspose.Cells provides the [Cell.GetValidation()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/cell/methods/getvalidation) method for this purpose. If there is no validation applied on the cell, it returns null.

Similarly, you can use [Worksheet.Validations.GetValidationInCell](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/validationcollection/methods/getvalidationincell) method to acquire the validation applied to a cell by providing its row and column indices.

Below code sample, shows you how to get validation applied on a cell.
