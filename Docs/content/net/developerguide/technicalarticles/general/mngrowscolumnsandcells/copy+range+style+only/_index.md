# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Copy Range Style Only


[Copy Range Data Only](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/technicalarticles/general/mngrowscolumnsandcells/copy+range+data+only) and [Copy Range Data with Style](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/technicalarticles/general/mngrowscolumnsandcells/copy+range+data+with+style) explained how to copy data from a range to another on its own or complete with formatting. It is also possible to copy only the formatting. This article shows how.

This example creates a workbook, populates it with data and copies a range's style only.

1.  Create a range.
2.  Create a [Style](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/style) object with specified formatting attributes.
3.  Apply the style formatting to the range.
4.  Create a second range of cells.
5.  Copy the first range's formatting to the second range.
