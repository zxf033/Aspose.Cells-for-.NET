# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Adding Custom Labels to Data Points in the Series of the Chart


You can add custom labels to data points in the series of the chart. Aspose.Cells provides [ChartPoint.DataLabels.Text](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.charts/datalabels/properties/text) property to add these custom labels. This article will explain how to use this property to add custom labels to data points in the series of the chart.

The following code creates **Scatter Chart Connected By Lines With Data Markers** and then adds **Custom Labels** to the **Data Points** in the **Series** of the **Chart**. Each custom label shows theÂ **Series Name** and **Point Name**. You can use any other text instead of it.
