# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Custom Slice or Sector Colors in Pie Chart


This article explains how to add custom colors to pie chart slices/sectors. By default, pie charts use the Microsoft Excel default template. To use other colors, redefine the colors in the chart.

To set a custom color for a pie chart's individual slices or sectors:

1.  Access the [Series](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.charts/series) object's [ChartPoint](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.charts/chartpoint).
2.  Assign the color of your choice using the [ChartPoint.Area.ForegroundColor](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/area/properties/foregroundcolor) property.

This article also explains how to:

*   A chart's category data.
*   A chart title linked to a cell.
*   The chart title font settings.
*   The position of the legend.

[ChartPoint.Area.ForegroundColor](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/area/properties/foregroundcolor) is not specific to pie charts but it can be used for all types of charts.
