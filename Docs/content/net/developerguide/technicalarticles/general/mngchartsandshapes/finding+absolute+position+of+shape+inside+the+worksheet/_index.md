# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Finding Absolute Position of Shape inside the Worksheet


Sometimes, you need to know the absolute position of a shape in a worksheet. Aspose.Cells provides the [Shape.LeftToCorner](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/lefttocorner) and [Shape.TopToCorner](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/shape/properties/toptocorner) properties for this purpose. These properties return the absolute position of the shape inside the worksheet in pixels.

The following sample code displays the absolute position of the first shape in the worksheet in pixels. The sample code displays the following console output:

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
Absolute Position of this Shape is (320 , 183)
{{< /code >}}
