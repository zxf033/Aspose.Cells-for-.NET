# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Create Signature Line in an Excel Workbook using Aspose.Cells


Microsoft Excel provides a feature to add **Signature Line** in Excel workbooks. You can add a Signature Line by clicking the **Insert** Tab and then selecting **Signature Line** from the **Text** group.

Aspose.Cells also provides this feature and has exposed the [Picture.SignatureLine](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/picture/properties/signatureline) property for this purpose. This article will explain how to use this property to add a Signature Line using Aspose.Cells.

The following sample code adds a Signature Line using [Picture.SignatureLine](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.drawing/picture/properties/signatureline)Â property and saves the workbook.
