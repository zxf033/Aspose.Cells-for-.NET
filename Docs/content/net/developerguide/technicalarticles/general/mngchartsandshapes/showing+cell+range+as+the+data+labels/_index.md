# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Showing Cell Range as the Data Labels


In Microsoft Excel 2013, you can display a cell range for data labels. Aspose.Cells supports this feature.

## Check-box to Show Cell Range as Data Labels

To show the cell range as data labels in Microsoft Excel:

1.  Select the series data labels and right-click to open the context menu.
2.  Select **Format Data Labels**. Label options are displayed.
3.  Select or clear the option **Label Contains - Value From Cells**.

The sample code below accesses a chart series data labels and sets the [DataLabels.ShowCellRange](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells.charts/datalabels/properties/showcellrange)Â property to **true** to select the **Label Contains - Value From Cells** option.
