# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Reading and Writing Query Table of Worksheet


Aspose.Cells provides `Worksheet.QueryTables` collection which returns the object of type `QueryTable` by index. It has the following two properties

*   `QueryTable.AdjustColumnWidth`
*   `QueryTable.PreserveFormatting`

These are both boolean values. You can view them in Microsoft Excel via `Data > Connections > Properties`.

## Reading and Writing Query Table of Worksheet

The following sample code reads the first `QueryTable` of the first worksheet and then prints both of the `QueryTable` properties. Then it sets the `QueryTable.PreserveFormatting` to true.
