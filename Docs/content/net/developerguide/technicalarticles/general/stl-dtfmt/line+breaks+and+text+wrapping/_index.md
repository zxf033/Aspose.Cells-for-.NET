# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Line Breaks and Text Wrapping


To ensure that text in a cell can be read, explicit line breaks and text wrapping can be applied. Text wrapping turns one line into several in a cell, which explicit line breaks put in breaks exactly where you want them.

# To Wrap Text in a Cell

To wrap text in a cell, use the [Aspose.Cells.Style.IsTextWrapped](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/style/properties/istextwrapped) property.

# To Use Explicit Line Breaks

You can use ‘\\n’ in C# and ‘ vbLf’ in VB.NET to insert explicit line breaks in a cell.
