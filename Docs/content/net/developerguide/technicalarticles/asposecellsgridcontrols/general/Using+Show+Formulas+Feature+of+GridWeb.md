# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Using Show Formulas Feature of GridWeb


Sometimes, you need to find an easy way for the cells containing formulas. You need to have an approach to quickly read through all formulas to check for errors. This can help you to trace the data being used in a formula.

Aspose.Cells.GridWeb provides the feature what is called Show Formulas in Microsoft Excel.

## Using Show Formulas Feature

All you need to use a shortcut "CTRL + ~" to display all the formulas in the worksheet.

For example, we load a template file into the GridWeb which has formulas in the C column, here is the code we simply used to load the file.

The file is loaded into the GridWeb and we can see a sheet with all the values in the picture below.
