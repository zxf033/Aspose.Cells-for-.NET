# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Resize Rows and Columns


Sometimes cell values are wider that the cell they are in, or are on several lines. Such values are not fully visible to users unless they change the height and width of rows and columns. Aspose.Cells.GridWeb fully supports setting row heights and column width. This topic discusses these features in detail with the help of examples.
