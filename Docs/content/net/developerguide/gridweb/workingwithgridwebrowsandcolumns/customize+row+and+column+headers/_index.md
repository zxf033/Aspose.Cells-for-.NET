# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Customize Row and Column Headers


Like Microsoft Excel, Aspose.Cells.GridWeb also uses standard headers or captions for rows (numbers like 1, 2, 3 and so on) and columns (alphabetic like A, B, C and so on). Aspose.Cells.GridWeb also makes it possible to customize captions. This topic discuss customizing row and column headers at runtime using Aspose.Cells.GridWeb API.
