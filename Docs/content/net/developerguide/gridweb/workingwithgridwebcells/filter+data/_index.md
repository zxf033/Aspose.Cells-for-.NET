# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Filter Data


Aspose.Cells.GridWeb provides auto-filter and custom data filter features. These features give you a way to select only those items in a worksheet that you want to display in a list. Moreover, you can filter items in a list according to set criteria. Filter text, numbers or dates with the filtering features.

## Working with Filters

Use the worksheet `AddAutoFilter` method to enable auto-filter for a worksheet. This method accepts the row, start and end column indexes.

To enable custom filter, use the worksheet `AddCustomFilter` method which accepts the row index to which filter has to be applied and the custom filtering criteria.

The example below implements both auto- and custom data filters. In the example, the auto-filter feature is enabled and filtered rows are searched based on some criteria.
