# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Rename Worksheets


Renaming a worksheet can be very useful when working with many worksheets in Aspose.Cells.GridWeb and decide to change their names to make them more meaningful. For example, a worksheet containing an invoice can be renamed Invoice instead of Sheet1. This topic describes this simple but useful feature.

## Renaming a Worksheet

All worksheets contain a `Name` property that allows developers to access or modify worksheets' names. To rename a worksheet:

1.  Access a worksheet from the `GridWorksheetCollection`.
2.  Rename the selected worksheet.

For more details on how to access worksheets in Aspose.Cells.GridWeb, please refer to [Access Worksheets](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/gridweb/workingwithgridwebworksheets/access+worksheets).

Before executing the code, the worksheet has a default name, such as Sheet1.

**Input file: a worksheet with a default name Sheet1**

After running the code, the worksheet is renamed Students.

**Output: the worksheet is renamed Students**
