# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Import DataView to GridWeb


With the release of the Microsoft .NET Framework, a new way of storing data was introduced. Now `DataSet`, `DataTable` and `DataView` objects that store data in offline mode. These objects are very handy as data repositories. Using Aspose.Cells.GridWeb, it's possible to import data from either `DataTable` or `DataView` objects into worksheets. Aspose.Cells.GridWeb only supports importing data from a `DataView`. object but a DataTable object can also be used indirectly. Let's discuss this feature in detail.

## Importing Data from DataView

Import data from a `DataView` object using the `GridWorsheetCollection`'s `ImportDataView` method in the GridWeb control. Pass the `DataView` object that you want to import data from to the `ImportDataView` method. It's possible to specify column header and data styles during import.

When data is imported from a `DataView` object, a new worksheet is created to hold the imported data. The worksheet is named the same as the `DataTable`.

The widths of the columns are adjusted to show all the data they contain. When the data is imported from `DataView`, column widths are not adjusted automatically. Users need to adjust them by themselves. To adjust the column widths programmatically, refer to [Resize Rows and Columns](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/gridweb/workingwithgridwebrowsandcolumns/resize+rows+and+columns).

An overloaded version of the `ImportDataView` method allows developers to specify the name of the sheet that holds the imported data and a specific number of rows and columns to import from the `DataView` object.
