# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Print GridWeb


There are times when developers need to print the GridWeb contents from a web page without saving the result as Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file. The Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control supports this feature via client side function.

## Printing GridWeb

In order to print the contents, the Aspose.Cells.GridWeb for .NET has exposed the `GridWeb.Print` client-side function which can be used in a JavaScript call as demonstrated below.

Once the JavaScript function is in place, it can be triggered on any event of choice. Please check the following ASP.NET snippet which uses the above defined JavaScript function on a button click event.
