## Possible Usage Scenarios

Sometimes you need to execute your client side function when GridWeb page changes. Aspose.Cells.GridWeb provides the `OnPageChangeClientFunction` property for this purpose. Please set this property with client side function which you want to execute.

## Execute client side function on GridWeb page change

The following aspx markup explains how to make use of the `OnPageChangeClientFunction` property. It sets the property with the client side function named `MyOnPageChange`. Please note, this property is valid only if you have enabled paging i.e. `EnablePaging="true"`. Now, whenever you will change the GridWeb page, it will call the client side function `MyOnPageChange` which prints the **current page index** on the **console** as shown in this screenshot.

## Sample Code

This is the code of the client side function `MyOnPageChange` that will be executed because of setting `OnPageChangeClientFunction ="MyOnPageChange"` property in GridWeb. This is the complete aspx page markup.
