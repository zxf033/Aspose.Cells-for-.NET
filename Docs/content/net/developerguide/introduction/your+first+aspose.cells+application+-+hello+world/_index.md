## Creating the Hello World Application

The steps below creates the Hello World application using the Aspose.Cells API:

1.  Create an instance of the [`Workbook`](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=cellsnet&title=Aspose.Cells.Workbook+Class&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=5018387) class.
2.  If you have a license, then [apply it](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/gettingstarted/licensing).  
    If you are using the evaluation version, skip the license related code lines.
3.  Create a new Excel file, or open an existing Excel file.
4.  Access any desired cell of a worksheet in the Excel file.
5.  Insert the words **Hello World!** into a cell accessed.
6.  Generate the modified Microsoft Excel file.

The implementation of above steps is demonstrated in the examples below.

### Code Sample: Creating a New Workbook

The following example creates a new workbook from the scratch, writes Hello World! into cell A1 on the first worksheet and saves the Excel file.

### Code Sample: Opening an Existing File
