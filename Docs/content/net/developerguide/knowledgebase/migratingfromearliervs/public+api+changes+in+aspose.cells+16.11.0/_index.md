# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Public API Changes in Aspose.Cells 16.11.0


This document describes the changes to the Aspose.Cells API from version 16.10.0 to 16.11.0 that may be of interest to module/application developers. It includes not only new and updated public methods, added & removed classes etc., but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Cells.

## Added APIs

### Support for Globalization Settings

Aspose.Cells 16.11.0 has exposed the `GlobalizationSettings` class along with `WorkbookSettings.GlobalizationSettings` property in order to enforce the Aspose.Cells APIs to use custom labels for Subtotals. The `GlobalizationSettings` class has the following methods which can be overridden in the custom implementation to give desired names to the labels **Total** & **Grand Total**.

*   `GlobalizationSettings.GetTotalName`: Gets the total name of the function.
*   `GlobalizationSettings.GetGrandTotalName`: Gets the grand total name of the function.

Here is a simple custom class that extends `GlobalizationSettings` class and overrides its aforementioned methods to return custom labels for the consolidation function Average.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
class CustomSettings : GlobalizationSettings
{
    public override string GetTotalName(ConsolidationFunction functionType)
    {
        switch (functionType)
        {
            case ConsolidationFunction.Average:
                return "AVG";
            default:
                return base.GetTotalName(functionType);
        }
    }

    public override string GetGrandTotalName(ConsolidationFunction functionType)
    {
        switch (functionType)
        {
            case ConsolidationFunction.Average:
                return "GRD AVG";
            default:
                return base.GetGrandTotalName(functionType);
        }
    }
}
{{< /code >}}

Following snippet loads an existing spreadsheet and adds the Subtotal of type Average on data already available in the worksheet. The `CustomSettings` class and its `GetTotalName` & `GetGrandTotalName` methods will be called at the time of adding Subtotal to the worksheet.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
// Loads an existing spreadsheet containing some data
Workbook book = new Workbook(dir + "sample.xlsx");

// Assigns the GlobalizationSettings property of the WorkbookSettings class
// to the class created in first step
book.Settings.GlobalizationSettings = new Cells.CustomSettings();

// Accesses the 1st worksheet from the collection which contains data
// Data resides in the cell range A2:B9
Worksheet sheet = book.Worksheets[0];

// Adds SubTotal of type Average to the worksheet
sheet.Cells.Subtotal(CellArea.CreateCellArea("A2", "B9"), 0, ConsolidationFunction.Average, new int[] { 0,1 });

// Calculates Formulas
book.CalculateFormula();

// Auto fits all columns
sheet.AutoFitColumns();

// Saves the workbook on disc
book.Save(dir + "output.xlsx");
{{< /code >}}

The `GlobalizationSettings` class also offers the `GetOtherName` method which is useful to get the name of "Other" labels for Pie charts. Here is a simple usage scenario of `GlobalizationSettings.GetOtherName` method.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
class CustomSettings : GlobalizationSettings
{
    public override string GetOtherName()
    {
        int lcid = System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.LCID;
        switch (lcid)
        {
            case 1033:
                return "Other";
            case 1036:
                return "Autre";
            case 1031:
                return "Andere";

            //Do other case

            default:
                return base.GetOtherName();
        }
    }
}
{{< /code >}}

The following snippet loads an existing spreadsheet containing a Pie chart, and renders the chart to image while utilizing the `CustomSettings` class created above.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
// Loads an existing spreadsheet containing a pie chart
Workbook book = new Workbook(dir + "sample.xlsx");

// Assigns the GlobalizationSettings property of the WorkbookSettings class
// to the class created in first step
book.Settings.GlobalizationSettings = new Cells.CustomSettings();

// Accesses the 1st worksheet from the collection which contains pie chart
Worksheet sheet = book.Worksheets[0];

// Accesses the 1st chart from the collection
Chart chart = sheet.Charts[0];

// Refreshes the chart
chart.Calculate();

// Renders the chart to image
chart.ToImage(dir + "output.png", new ImageOrPrintOptions());
{{< /code >}}

### Added CellsFactory Class

Aspose.Cells 16.11.0 has exposed the `CellsFactory` class which currently has one method, that is; `CreateStyle`. The `CellsFactory.CreateStyle` method can be used to create an instance of `Style` class without adding it to the pool of workbook styles.

Here is simple usage scenario of `CellsFactory.CreateStyle` method.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
// Initializes the CellsFactory class
CellsFactory factory = new CellsFactory();

// Creates an instance of Style
Style style = factory.CreateStyle();
{{< /code >}}

### Added Workbook.AbsolutePath Property

Aspose.Cells 16.11.0 has exposed the `Workbook.AbsolutePath` property allows to get or set the absolute workbook path stored in workbook.xml file. This property is useful while updating the external links only.

### Added GridHyperlinkCollection.GetHyperlink Method

Aspose.Cells.GridWeb 16.11.0 has exposed `GetHyperlink` method to the `GridHyperlinkCollection` class that allows to get the instance of `GridHyperlink` by either passing an instance `GridCell` or a pair of integers corresponding to the row column indices.

In case no hyperlink has been found on the specified cell then the `GetHyperlink` method would return null.

Here is simple usage scenario of `GetHyperlink` method.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
// Gets the active worksheet from the collection
GridWorksheet sheet = GridWeb1.WorkSheets[GridWeb1.ActiveSheetIndex];

// Accesses the GridHyperlinkCollection
GridHyperlinkCollection links = sheet.Hyperlinks;

// Gets hyperlink from cell A1
GridHyperlink link = links.GetHyperlink(sheet.Cells["A1"]);

// Gets hyperlink from cell D1
link = links.GetHyperlink(0, 3);
{{< /code >}}

## Obsoleted APIs

### Obsoleted Style Constructor

Please use `cellsFactory.CreateStyle` method as an alternative.

## Deleted APIs

### Deleted Cell.GetConditionalStyle Method

Please use `Cell.GetConditionalFormattingResult` method instead.

### Deleted Cells.MaxDataRowInColumn(int column) Method

Please use `Cells.GetLastDataRow(int)` method as an alternative.

### Deleted PageSetup.Draft Property

It is advised to use the `PageSetup.PrintDraft` property instead.

### Deleted AutoFilter.FilterColumnCollection Property

Please consider using `AutoFilter.FilterColumns` property to achieve the same goal.

### Deleted TickLabels.Rotation Property

Please use `TickLabels.RotationAngle` property instead.
