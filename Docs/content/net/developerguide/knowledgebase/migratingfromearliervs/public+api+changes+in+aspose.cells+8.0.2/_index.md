# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Public API Changes in Aspose.Cells 8.0.2


This document describes changes to the Aspose.Cells API from version 8.0.1 to 8.0.2, that may be of interest to module/application developers. It includes not only new and updated public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Cells.

### Added TextDirection Property to Shape Class

The `Shape` class has exposed `TextDirection` property which can be used get or set the direction of the text flow for the `Shape` object. The `TextDirection` property can also be used to set the desired text direction for the comments in a spreadsheet as demonstrated below.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
//Instantiate a new Workbook
var book = new Workbook();

//Get the first worksheet
var sheet = book.Worksheets[0];

//Add a comment to A1 cell
var comment = sheet.Comments[sheet.Comments.Add("A1")];

//Set its vertical alignment setting            
comment.CommentShape.TextVerticalAlignment  = TextAlignmentType.Center;

//Set its horizontal alignment setting
comment.CommentShape.TextHorizontalAlignment = TextAlignmentType.Right;

//Set the Text Direction - Right-to-Left
comment.CommentShape.TextDirection = TextDirectionType.RightToLeft;

//Set the Comment note
comment.Note = "This is my Comment Text. This is test";

//Save the Excel file
book.Save(myDir + "output.xlsx");
{{< /code >}}

Please check the detailed article on [Changing Text Direction of the Comment](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/technicalarticles/general/stl-dtfmt/change+text+direction+of+the+comment)

### Added ConvertFormulasData Property to HTMLLoadOptions Class

`ConvertFormulasData` property has been added to the `HTMLLoadOptions` Class, in order to facilitate the developers to load Excel formulas from HTML files. The boolean `ConvertFormulasData` property indicates whether or not to convert the string to a formula when the string value starts with character '='.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
//Create an instance of HTMLLoadOptions
HTMLLoadOptions loadOptions = new HTMLLoadOptions();

//Set ConvertFormulasData to true
loadOptions.ConvertFormulasData = true;

//Create an instance of Workbook and load an HTML based spreadsheet 
//while passing the instance of HTMLLoadOptions
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(myDir + "spreadsheet.html", loadOptions);
{{< /code >}}

The default value of `ConvertFormulasData` property is false.

### Added ImageOptions Property to HtmlSaveOptions Class

`ImageOptions` property has been added to the `HtmlSaveOptions` Class. Exposing the `ImageOptions` property has enabled the developers to set the preferences for the images embedded in the HTML while exporting spreadsheets.

### Obsoleted HtmlSaveOptions.ExportChartImageFormat Property

`HtmlSaveOptions.ExportChartImageFormat` has been marked obsolete starting from Aspose.Cells for .NET 8.0.2. It is advised to use `HtmlSaveOptions.ImageOptions` instead for image format settings while exporting spreadsheets to HTML format.
