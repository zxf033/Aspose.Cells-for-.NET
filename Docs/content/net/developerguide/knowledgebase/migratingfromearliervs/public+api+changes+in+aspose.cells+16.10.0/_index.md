# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Public API Changes in Aspose.Cells 16.10.0


This document describes the changes to the Aspose.Cells API from version 9.0.0 to 16.10.0 that may be of interest to module/application developers. It includes not only new and updated public methods, added & removed classes etc., but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Cells.

## Added APIs

### Support for Reflection Effects

Aspose.Cells 16.10.0 has exposed the `ReflectionEffect` class along with `Shape.Reflection` property in order to control the reflection effects of a `Shape` object. The `ReflectionEffect` class has the following properties.

*   `ReflectionEffect.Blur`: Gets/sets the blur radius in unit of points.
*   `ReflectionEffect.Direction`: Gets/sets the direction of the alpha gradient ramp relative to the shape itself.
*   `ReflectionEffect.Distance`: Gets/sets distance of the reflection in unit of points.
*   `ReflectionEffect.FadeDirection`: Gets/sets the direction to offset the reflection.
*   `ReflectionEffect.RotWithShape`: Gets/sets if the reflection should rotate with the shape.
*   `ReflectionEffect.Size`: Gets/sets the end position (along the alpha gradient ramp) of the end alpha value in unit of percentage .
*   `ReflectionEffect.Transparency`: Gets/sets the degree of the starting reflection transparency as a value from 0.0 (opaque) through 1.0 (clear).
*   `ReflectionEffect.Type`: Gets/sets the preset reflection effect.

Here is simple usage scenario of `Shape.Reflection` property.
