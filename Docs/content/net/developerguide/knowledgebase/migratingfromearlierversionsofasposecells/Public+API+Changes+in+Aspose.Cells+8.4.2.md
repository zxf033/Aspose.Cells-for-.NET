Aspose.Cells for .NET : Public API Changes in Aspose.Cells 8.4.2  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Public API Changes in Aspose.Cells 8.4.2


This document describes the changes to the Aspose.Cells API from version 8.4.1 to 8.4.2 that may be of interest to module/application developers. It includes not only new and updated public methods, [added classes etc.](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/knowledgebase/migratingfromearlierversionsofasposecells/public+api+changes+in+aspose.cells+8.4.2), but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Cells.

## Added APIs

### Improved Chart Creation Mechanism

The `Aspose.Cells.Charts.Chart` class has exposed the `SetChartDataRange` method to ease the task of chart creation. The `SetChartDataRange` method accepts two parameters, where first parameter is of type string that specifies the cell area from which to plot the data series. The second parameter is of type Boolean that specifies the plot orientation, that is; whether to plot the chart data series from a range of cell values by row or by columns.

The following code snippet shows how to create a column chart with few lines of code assuming the the chart's plot series data is present on the same worksheet from cell A1 to D4.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
//Add a new chart of type Column to chart collection
int idx = worksheet.Charts.Add(ChartType.Column, 6, 5, 20, 13);

//Retrieve the newly added chart instance
Chart chart = worksheet.Charts[idx];

//Specify the chart's data series from cell A1 to D4
chart.SetChartDataRange("A1:D4", true);
{{< /code >}}

### Method VbaModuleCollection.Add Added

Aspose.Cells for .NET 8.4.2 has exposed the `VbaModuleCollection.Add` method to add a new VBA module to the instance of `Workbook`. The `VbaModuleCollection.Add` method accepts a parameter of type of `Worksheet` to add a worksheet specific module.

The following code snippet shows how to use the `VbaModuleCollection.Add` method.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
//Create new workbook
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//Access first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Add VBA module for first worksheet
int idx = workbook.VbaProject.Modules.Add(worksheet);

//Access the VBA Module, set its name and code
Aspose.Cells.Vba.VbaModule module = workbook.VbaProject.Modules[idx];
module.Name = "TestModule";

module.Codes = "Sub ShowMessage()" + "\r\n" +
"    MsgBox \"Welcome to Aspose!\"" + "\r\n" +
"End Sub";

//Save the workbook
workbook.Save(output, SaveFormat.Xlsm);
{{< /code >}}

### Overloaded Method Cells.CopyColumns Added

Aspose.Cells for .NET 8.4.2 has exposed an overloaded version of `Cells.CopyColumns` method to repeat the source columns onto the destination. The newly exposed method accepts 5 parameters in total, where first 4 parameters are the same as of the common `Cells.CopyColumns` method. However, the last parameter of type int specifies the number of destination columns onto which the source columns have to be repeated.

The following code snippet shows how to use the newly exposed `Cells.CopyColumns` method.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
//Load an existing workbook
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(input);

//Access first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Access cells of first worksheet
Cells cells = worksheet.Cells;

//Copy the first two columns (A & B) along with formatting
//to columns G, H & I.
//Please note, the columns G & H will be replaced by A & B respectively
//whereas, column I will be replaced by the column A
cells.CopyColumns(cells, 0, 2, 6, 3);

//Save the workbook
workbook.Save(output);
{{< /code >}}

### Enumeration Fields PasteType.Default & PasteType.DefaultExceptBorders Added

With the release of v8.4.2, the Aspose.Cells API has added 2 new enumeration fields for `PasteType` as detailed below.

*   `PasteType.Default`: Works similar to Excel's "All" functionality for pasting range of cells.
*   `PasteType.DefaultExceptBorders`: Works similar to Excel's "All except borders" functionality for pasting range of cells.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of `PasteType.Default` field.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
//Load an existing workbook
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(input);

//Access first worksheet
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Access cells of first worksheet
Cells cells = worksheet.Cells;

//Create source & destination ranges
Range source = cells.CreateRange("A1:B6");
Range destination = cells.CreateRange("D1:E6");

//Copy the source range onto the destination range with everything except column widths
destination.Copy(source, new PasteOptions() { PasteType = PasteType.Default });

//Save the workbook
workbook.Save(output);
{{< /code >}}

Starting from the release of Aspose.Cells for .NET 8.4.2, the enumeration filed `PasteType.All` behaves differently as compared to Excel's "All" functionality to paste range of cells. Now, the `PasteType.All` also copies the column widths onto the destination range as opposed to Excel's "All" functionality. In order to mimic the Excel's "All" behavior, please use the `PasteType.Default`.
