Aspose.Cells for .NET : Public API Changes in Aspose.Cells 8.0.1  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Public API Changes in Aspose.Cells 8.0.1


These page list public API changes that were introduced in Aspose.Cells 8.0.1. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Cells which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.

### MemorySetting Property Added to Cells Class

`Cells` class has exposed `MemorySetting` property which can be used to optimize the memory usage for cells data, and hence decrease the overall memory cost. The following example shows how to write a large data to a worksheet in optimized mode.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
//Instantiate a new Workbook
Workbook book = new Workbook();

//Set the memory preferences
book.Settings.MemorySetting = MemorySetting.MemoryPreference;

//To change the memory setting of existing sheets, please change memory setting for them manually:
Cells cells = book.Worksheets[0].Cells;
cells.MemorySetting = MemorySetting.MemoryPreference;
//Input large dataset into the cells of the worksheet
//Your code goes here
{{< /code >}}

The memory settings will not work for the default sheet automatically created by the Workbook object. In order to change the memory settings of existing sheets, please apply the memory setting manually before performing any data manipulation.
