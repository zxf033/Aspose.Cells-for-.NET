Aspose.Cells for .NET : Public API Changes in Aspose.Cells 16.12.0  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Public API Changes in Aspose.Cells 16.12.0


This document describes the changes to the Aspose.Cells API from version 16.11.0 to 16.12.0 that may be of interest to module/application developers. It includes not only new and updated public methods, added & removed classes etc., but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in Aspose.Cells.

## Added APIs

### Filter Objects at Load Time

Aspose.Cells 16.12.0 has exposed the `LoadFilter` class along with `LoadOptions.LoadFilter` property which together can control the type of data to be loaded while initializing an instance of `Workbook` from a template file.

Here is a simple usage scenario to load only the document properties from a template file.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
// Create an instance of LoadOptions class
var options = new Aspose.Cells.LoadOptions();

// Set the LoadFilter property to a new instance of LoadFilter class
// Select to load document properties by passing LoadDataFilterOptions.DocumentProperties to constructor
options.LoadFilter = new Aspose.Cells.LoadFilter(Aspose.Cells.LoadDataFilterOptions.DocumentProperties);

// Load a template file by passing file path as well as instance of LoadOptions class
var book = new Aspose.Cells.Workbook(dir + "sample.xlsx", options);
{{< /code >}}

Following snippet loads everything from an existing spreadsheet except for the charts.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
// Create an instance of LoadOptions class
var options = new Aspose.Cells.LoadOptions();

// Set the LoadFilter property to a new instance of LoadFilter class with appropriate parameters to the constructor
options.LoadFilter = new Aspose.Cells.LoadFilter(Aspose.Cells.LoadDataFilterOptions.All & ~Aspose.Cells.LoadDataFilterOptions.Chart);

// Load a template file by passing file path as well as instance of LoadOptions class
var book = new Aspose.Cells.Workbook(dir + "sample.xlsx", options);
{{< /code >}}

Following code loads only the cell data (along with formulas) and formatting from an existing spreadsheet.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
// Create an instance of LoadOptions class
var options = new Aspose.Cells.LoadOptions();

// Set the LoadFilter property to a new instance of LoadFilter class with appropriate parameters to constructor
options.LoadFilter = new Aspose.Cells.LoadFilter(Aspose.Cells.LoadDataFilterOptions.CellData);

// Load a template file by passing file path as well as instance of LoadOptions class
var book = new Aspose.Cells.Workbook(dir + "sample.xlsx", options);
{{< /code >}}

The `LoadFilter` class also allows to customize the loading process as per the properties of the `Worksheet`. In order to customize the loading process as per worksheet, one has to override the `LoadFilter.StartSheet` method as demonstrated below.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
class CustomFilter : Aspose.Cells.LoadFilter
{
    public override void StartSheet(Worksheet sheet)
    {
        if (sheet.Name == "Sheet1")
        {
            // Load everything
            m_LoadDataFilterOptions = Aspose.Cells.LoadDataFilterOptions.All;
        }
        else
        {
            // Load nothing
            m_LoadDataFilterOptions = Aspose.Cells.LoadDataFilterOptions.None;
        }
    }
}
{{< /code >}}

The following snippet make use of the `CustomFilter` class defined above.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
// Create an instance of LoadOptions class
var options = new Aspose.Cells.LoadOptions();

// Set the LoadFilter property to a new instance of CustomFilter class
options.LoadFilter = new CustomFilter();

// Load a template file by passing file path as well as instance of LoadOptions class
var book = new Aspose.Cells.Workbook(dir + "sample.xlsx", options);
{{< /code >}}

### Added FileFormatType.OTS Enumeration

Aspose.Cells 16.12.0 has added `OTS` entry to the `FileFormatType` enumeration in order to detect the format of OTS files.

The following snippet make use of the `FileFormatType.OTS`.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
// Load a sample in an instance of FileStream
var stream = File.OpenRead(dir + "sample.ots");

// Detect the format of the stream
var fileFormatInfo = Aspose.Cells.FileFormatUtil.DetectFileFormat(stream);
            
// Check if stream is of type OTS
Debug.Assert(fileFormatInfo.FileFormatType == FileFormatType.OTS);
{{< /code >}}

### Added FontConfigs.PreferSystemFontSubstitutes Property

Aspose.Cells 16.12.0 has exposed `PreferSystemFontSubstitutes` property for the `FontConfigs` class. The `FontConfigs.PreferSystemFontSubstitutes` property is of type Boolean, indicating if the API should use the system's font substitution mechanism first, in case a required font is not present and no substitution for the particular font has been defined. The default value of `FontConfigs.PreferSystemFontSubstitutes` property is `false`.

### Added BuiltInDocumentPropertyCollection.ScaleCrop Property

Aspose.Cells 16.12.0 has added the `ScaleCrop` property to the `BuiltInDocumentPropertyCollection` class. The `ScaleCrop` indicates the display mode of the document thumbnail. Setting this element to `true` enables the scaling of the document thumbnail as per display whereas setting it to `false` enables the cropping of the document thumbnail to show the section that fits the display.

### Added BuiltInDocumentPropertyCollection.LinksUpToDate Property

Aspose.Cells 16.12.0 has also exposed the `LinksUpToDate` property for the `BuiltInDocumentPropertyCollection` class. The `LinksUpToDate` property indicates if the hyperlinks in a document are up-to-date.

### Added Workbook.ExportXml Method

Aspose.Cells 16.12.0 has exposed the `Workbook.ExportXml` method that allows to store the XML map data to specified file path. The `Workbook.ExportXml` method accepts 2 parameters where the first parameter of type string should be the XML map name and second parameter should be the file path location to store the XML data.

### Added WorksheetCollection.CreateRange Method

Aspose.Cells 16.12.0 has added the `WorksheetCollection.CreateRange` method that allows to create range based on an address (cell area reference) & `Worksheet` index.

The following snippet make use of the `WorksheetCollection.CreateRange` method to create a range of cells spanning over A1 to A2 in first (default) worksheet.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
// Create an instance of Workbook
var book = new Aspose.Cells.Workbook();

// Access WorksheetCollection from the Workbook
var sheets = book.Worksheets;
        
// Create a range in first worksheet
var range = sheets.CreateRange("A1:A2", 0);
{{< /code >}}
