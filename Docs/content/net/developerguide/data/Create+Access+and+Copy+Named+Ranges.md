## Introduction

Normally, column and row labels are used refer to individual cells. It is possible to create descriptive names to represent cells, ranges of cells, formulas, or constant values. The word **name** may refer to a string of characters that represents a cell, range of cells, formula, or constant value. Assigning a name to a range means that that range of cells can be referred to by its name. Use easy-to-understand names, such as Products, to refer to hard to understand ranges, such as Sales!C20:C30. Labels can be used in formulas that refer to data on the same worksheet; if you want to represent a range on another worksheet, you may use a name. \*Named ranges are among the most powerful features of Microsoft Excel, especially when used as the source range for list controls, pivot tables, charts and so on.

## Working with Named Range Using Microsoft Excel

### Create Named Ranges

The following steps describe how to name a cell or range of cells using **MS Excel**. This method applies to **Microsoft Office Excel 2003**, **Microsoft Excel 97**, **2000** and **2002**.

1.  Select the cell, range of cells that you want to name.
2.  Click the **Name Box** at the left end of the formula bar.
3.  Type the name for the cells.
4.  Press ENTER.

You cannot name a cell while you are changing the contents of the cell.

## Working with Named Range Using Aspose.Cells

Here, we use the Aspose.Cells API to do the task.  
Aspose.Cells provides a class, `Workbook` that represents a Microsoft Excel file. The `Workbook` class contains a `Worksheets` collection that allows access to each worksheet in an Excel file. A worksheet is represented by the `Worksheet` class. The `Worksheet` class provides a `Cells` collection.

### Create Named Range

It is possible to create a named range by calling the overloaded `CreateRange` method of the `Cells` collection. A typical version of `CreateRange` method takes the following parameters:

*   Name of the upper left cell, the name of the top left cell in the range.
*   Name of the lower right cell, the name of the bottom right cell in the range.

When the `CreateRange` method is called, it returns the newly created range as an instance of the `Range` class. Use this `Range` object to configure the named range. For example, set the name of the range using the `Name` property. The following example shows how to create a named range of cells that extends over B4:G14.

### Input Data into the Cells in the Named Range

You can insert data into the individual cells of a range following the pattern

*   **C#**: Range\[row,column\]
*   **VB**: Range(row,column)

Say you have a named range of cells that spans A1:C4. The matrix makes 4 \* 3 = 12 cells. The individual range cells are arranged sequentially: Range\[0,0\], Range\[0,1\], Range\[0,2\], Range\[1,0\], Range\[1,1\], Range\[1,2\], Range\[2,0\], Range\[2,1\], Range\[2,2\], Range\[3,0\], Range\[3,1\], Range\[3,2\].

Use the following properties to identify the cells in the range:

*   `FirstRow` returns the index of the first row in the named range.
*   `FirstColumn` returns the index of the first column in the named range.
*   `RowCount` returns the total number of rows in the named range.
*   `ColumnCount` returns the total number of columns in the named range.

The following example shows how to input some values into the cells of a specified range.

### Identify Cells in the Named Range

You can insert data into the individual cells of a range following the pattern:

*   **C#**: Range\[row,column\]
*   **VB**: Range(row,column)

If you have a named range that spans A1:C4. The matrix makes 4 \* 3 = 12 cells. The individual range cells are arranged sequentially: Range\[0,0\], Range\[0,1\], Range\[0,2\], Range\[1,0\] ,Range\[1,1\], Range\[1,2\], Range\[2,0\], Range\[2,1\], Range\[2,2\], Range\[3,0\], Range\[3,1\], Range\[3,2\].

Use the following properties to identify the cells in the range:

*   `FirstRow` returns the index of the first row in the named range.
*   `FirstColumn` returns the index of the first column in the named range.
*   `RowCount` returns the total number of rows in the named range.
*   `ColumnCount` returns the total number of columns in the named range.

The following example shows how to input some values into the cells of a specified range.

### Access Named Ranges

#### Access a Specific Named Range

Call the `Worksheets` collection's `GetRangeByName` method to get a range by the specified name. A typical `GetRangeByName` method takes the name of the named range and returns the specified named range as an instance of the `Range` class. The following example shows how to access a specified range by its name.

#### Access All the Named Ranges in a Spreadsheet

Call the `Worksheet` collection's `GetNamedRanges` method to get all named ranges in a spreadsheet. The `GetNamedRanges` method returns an array of all names ranges in the `Worksheets` collection.

The following example shows how to access all the named ranges in a workbook.

### Copy Named Ranges

Aspose.Cells provides `Range.Copy()` method to copy a range of cells with formattings into another range.

The following example shows how to copy a source range of cells to another named range.
