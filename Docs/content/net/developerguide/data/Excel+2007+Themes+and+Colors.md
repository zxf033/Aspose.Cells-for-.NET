## Excel 2007 Themes and Colors

Themes provide a unified look with named styles, graphical effects and other objects used in a workbook. For example, the Accent1 style, for example, looks different in the Office and the Apex themes. Often, you apply a document theme and then amend it to how you want it.

Aspose.Cells provides features for customizing themes and colors.

### Get and Set Theme Colors

Below are a few methods and properties that implement theme colors.

*   [Style.ForegroundThemeColor](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/style/properties/foregroundthemecolor): Used to set the foreground color.
*   [Style.BackgroundThemeColor](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/style/properties/backgroundthemecolor): Used to set the background color.
*   [Font.ThemeColor](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/font/properties/themecolor): Used to set the font color.
