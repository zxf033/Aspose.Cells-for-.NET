Aspose.Cells also allows you to apply the Advanced Filter using the [Worksheet.AdvancedFilter()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/worksheet/methods/advancedfilter) method. Just like Microsoft Excel, it accepts the following parameters.

**isFilter**

Indicates whether filtering the list in place.

**listRange**

The list range.

**criteriaRange**

The criteria range.

**copyTo**

The range where copying data to.

**uniqueRecordOnly**

Only displaying or copying unique rows.

## Apply Advanced Filter of Microsoft Excel to Display Records Meeting Complex Criteria

The following sample code applies the advanced filter on the [Sample Excel File](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/48136879/48496692.xlsx) and generates the [Output Excel File](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/48136879/48496691.xlsx). The screenshot shows both files for comparison. As you can see inside the screenshot, data has been filtered inside the output Excel file according to complex criteria.
