## Possible Usage Scenarios

Sometimes, you want to change the alignment of multiple cells but also want to keep existing formatting. Aspose.Cells allows you to do it using the [StyleFlag.Alignments](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/styleflag/properties/alignments) property. If you will set it **true**, changes in alignment will take place otherwise not. Please note, [StyleFlag](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/styleflag) object is passed as a parameter to [Range.ApplyStyle()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/range/methods/applystyle) method which actually applies the formatting to a range of cells.

## Change Cells Alignment and Keep Existing Formatting

The following sample code loads the [sample Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/66950270/67338585.xlsx), creates the range and center aligns it horizontally and vertically and keeps the existing formatting intact. The following screenshot compares the sample Excel file and [output Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/66950270/67338586.xlsx) and shows that all existing formatting of the cells is the same except that cells are now center aligned horizontally and vertically.
