## Possible Usage Scenarios

Sometimes, you want to show subtotal and grand total labels in non-English languages like Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hindi etc. Aspose.Cells allows you to do this using the [GlobalizationSettings](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class and [Workbook.GlobalizationSettings](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/properties/globalizationsettings) property. Please see this article on how to make use of [GlobalizationSettings](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) class

*   [Using GlobalizationSettings Class for Custom Subtotal Labels and Other Label of Pie Chart](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/workbooksettings/using+globalizationsettings+class+for+custom+subtotal+labels+and+other+label+of+pie+chart)

## Implement Subtotal or Grand Total labels in other languages

The following sample code loads the [sample excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013580/5115151.xlsx) and implements subtotal and grand total names in the Chinese language. Please check the [output Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013580/5115152.xlsx) generated by this code for your reference. We first create a class of [GlobalizationSettings](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/globalizationsettings) and then use it in our code.

  
Now use above created class in the code like below:
