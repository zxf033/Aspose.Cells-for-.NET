## Handling Events after Deleting Columns and Rows in GridDesktop

The following sample code explains how to make use of `AfterDeleteColumns` and `AfterDeleteRows` events. Whenever you delete some columns or rows, the given function will be called and show a message box that displays the index of the deleted column or row.

## Sample Code

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
private void gridDesktop1_AfterDeleteColumnsAndRows(object sender, Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop.WorksheetEventArgs args)
{
    if(args.SheetEvents == Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop.WorksheetEvents.ColumnDeleted)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Deleted Column Index: " + args.Index);
    }

    if (args.SheetEvents == Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop.WorksheetEvents.RowDeleted)
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Deleted Row Index: " + args.Index);
    }
}
