## Example

Renaming a worksheet is a simple task that can be very useful. For example, if you want to label worksheets so that it is obvious what each one contains. For example, a model might have 12 worksheets, each named by month, to hold expense information.

1.  Add a Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop control to a form.
2.  Get the reference of a desired worksheet.
3.  Set the name of the worksheet using its reference.

Before changing the name of the worksheet, it's required to access the reference of that worksheet. There are many ways to access a worksheet reference. To learn about those ways, please refer to [Accessing Worksheets](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/griddesktop/worksheet/accessing+worksheet).
