## Adding Pictures

To add a hyperlink to a cell using Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop, please follow the steps below:

*   Add Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop control to your **Form**
*   Access any desired **Worksheet**
*   Add **Picture** to the worksheet by specifying the file path of picture and cell name where the picture will be inserted

**Pictures** collection in the **Worksheet** object provides an overloaded **Add** method. Developers can use any overloaded version of **Add** method according to their specific needs. Using these overloaded versions of **Add** method, it is possible to add a picture from file, stream or **Image** object.

Below is the sample code for adding pictures into worksheets.

## Accessing Pictures

To access and modify an existing picture in the worksheet, developers can access the picture from the **Pictures** collection of the **Worksheet** by specifying the cell (using cell name or its location in terms of row and column number) in which the picture is inserted. Once the picture is accessed, developers can modify its Image at runtime.

Below is the sample code to access and modify the pictures in a worksheet.

## Removing Pictures

To remove an existing picture, developers can simply access a desired worksheet and then **Remove** picture from the **Pictures** collection of the **Worksheet** by specifying the cell (using its name or row & column number) that contains the picture.

In code below it is shown how to remove pictures from worksheet.
