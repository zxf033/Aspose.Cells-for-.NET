# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Freeze Unfreeze Rows and Columns


This topic deals with the information about freezing and unfreezing rows and columns of a worksheet. Freezing columns or rows enables users to keep the column headings or row titles visible while they are scrolling to other parts of the worksheet. This feature is very helpful for scrolling through the worksheets that contain huge volumes of data. Because, in such cases, when users will scroll data then only data will be scrolled down and headings would stay there to increase the readability of data.
