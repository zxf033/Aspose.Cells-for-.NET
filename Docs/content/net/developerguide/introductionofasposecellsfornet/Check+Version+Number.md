Aspose.Cells for .NET : Check Version Number  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Check Version Number


Wonder which version of Aspose.Cells you are using? We publish new versions of Aspose.Cells, both to introduce new features and to fix issues, on a regular basis. The version number consists of major and minor version numbers, build and revision number. The major and minor version numbers are required; the build and revision versions are optional. Each number must be an integer from 0 up. The format is as follows (optional components are shown in square brackets ('\[' and '\]'):

`major.minor[.build[.revision]]`

When we release a new build of Aspose.Cells, we update the version number.

This article explains how to check which version of Aspose.Cells is installed on the system manually and using the Aspose.Cells API.
