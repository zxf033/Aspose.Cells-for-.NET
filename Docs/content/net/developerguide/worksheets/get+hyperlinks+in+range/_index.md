## Get Hyperlinks in Range

The [Range](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/range) class provides a [Hyperlinks](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/range/properties/hyperlinks) property which returns all the hyperlinks in the selected range. You may also delete the Hyperlink by calling the [Hyperlink.Delete](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/hyperlink/methods/delete) method.
