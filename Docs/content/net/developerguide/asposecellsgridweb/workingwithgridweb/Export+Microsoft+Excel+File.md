## Export Excel Files

### Export as a File

To save the content of Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control as an Excel file:

1.  Add the Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control to your web form.
2.  Save your work as an Excel file at a specified path.
3.  Run the application.

If you don't know about how to add Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control to your web form then you should refer to [Add GridWeb to Web Form](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/asposecellsgridweb/workingwithgridweb/add+gridweb+to+web+form)

When Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control is added to a windows form, the control is automatically instantiated and added to the form with a default size. You don't have to create an Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control object, all you have to do is drag and drop the control and start using it.

The code example below illustrates how to save grid content to an Excel file.

If your file system is NTFS, grant read/write access to the ASPNET or Everyone user accounts or you will get an access denied exception at runtime.

The above code snippet can be used in several ways. A common way is to add a button that saves the grid content to an Excel file when clicked. Aspose.Cells.GridWeb offers an easier approach for task. Aspose.Cells.GridWeb has an event called `SaveCommand`. The above code snippet can be added to the `SaveCommand` event's event handler which allow users to save their work by clicking the Aspose.Cells.GridWeb's in-built **Save** button.

If you are working in Visual Studio you can easily create the `SaveCommand` event's event handler by double-clicking the event in the **Properties** pane. To learn more about this, please refer to [Working with GridWeb Events](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/asposecellsgridweb/workingwithgridweb/working+with+gridweb+events)

### Export as a Stream

It is also possible to save grid content to a stream (for example `MemoryStream`).
