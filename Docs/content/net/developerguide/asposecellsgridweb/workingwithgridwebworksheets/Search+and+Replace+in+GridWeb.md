# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Search and Replace in GridWeb


One of the fastest ways to make repetitive changes in a large spreadsheet is to use the find and replace feature. Find helps you locate a text string or data and replace substitutes it with a new value. Aspose.Cells.GridWeb provides this feature. It enables you to search for and replace with a specific text string or value in the worksheet client-side through a simple dialog. It even allows you to look for partial data.
