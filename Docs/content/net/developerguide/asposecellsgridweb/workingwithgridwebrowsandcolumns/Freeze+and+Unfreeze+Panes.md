# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Freeze and Unfreeze Panes


This topic explains how to freeze and unfreeze rows and columns. Freezing columns or rows allows users to keep the column headings or row titles visible while they scroll to other parts of the worksheet. This feature is very helpful when working with worksheets that contain large volumes of data. When users scroll only data is scrolled down and the headings stay in place, making the date easier to read. The freeze panes feature is only supported in Internet Explorer 6.0 or above.
