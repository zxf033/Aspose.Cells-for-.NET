## Copying Rows & Columns

If you are not already acquainted with Aspose.Cells.GridWeb component, we strongly suggest you to check the [Introduction to Aspose.Cells.GridWeb](http://www.aspose.com/docs/display/cellsnet/Introduction+of+GridWeb) and detailed article on [How to add Aspose.Cells.GridWeb component in a WebForms application](http://www.aspose.com/docs/display/cellsnet/Creating+Control+on+a+Web+Form).

### Copying Single Row

In order to keep the example simple, the article uses an existing spreadsheet with one row and a simple formula that sums all the values in the row. Here is how the spreadsheet is displayed in the Aspose.Cells.GridWeb interface before copying the row.

The code snippet is simple as demonstrated below. It accesses `GridCells` object of active worksheet order to make a copy of the first row to the subsequent row.

  
Here is how the Aspose.Cells.GridWeb looks after copy row operation.

You may use the `GridCells.CopyRow` & `GridCells.CopyColumn` methods in loop to copy the source row & column to multiple rows & columns respectively.

### Copying Multiple Rows

It is also possible to copy multiple rows to a new destination while using the `GridCells.CopyRows` method, which takes an additional parameter of type integer to specify the number of source rows to be copied.

Here is how Aspose.Cells.GridWeb look before & after copy rows operation.
