Aspose.Cells for .NET : Write GridWeb Client Side Script  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Write GridWeb Client Side Script


Developers can write client-side scripts for the Aspose.Cells.GridWeb control. This means that it is possible to invoke a JavaScript function client-side to perform a specific task related to the GridWeb control. For example, developers can write JavaScript functions to submit GridWeb data to a server or show an alert message when a validation error occurs etc.

This topic explains this feature with the help of examples.

## Writing Client Side Scripts for Aspose.Cells.GridWeb

### Basic Information

Aspose.Cells.GridWeb provides two properties created specifically to support client-side scripts:

*   `OnSubmitClientFunction`
*   `OnValidationErrorClientFunction`

Create JavaScript functions in an ASPX page and assign the names of these functions to the `OnSubmitClientFunction` and `OnValidationErrorClientFunction` properties.

The JavaScript function that will be assigned to the `OnSubmitClientFunction` property must be defined properly as shown below:

**JavaScript**

{{< code lang="javascript" >}}
function function_name(arg, cancelEdit)
 {
   //Add javascript code here
 }
 
{{< /code >}}

where the \[arg\] parameter represents the command generated by the control. The command can be "Save", "Submit", "Undo" etc. and the \[cancelEdit\] parameter is a Boolean value, which indicates that whether the user input is cancelled or not.

Any JavaScript function assigned to the `OnSubmitClientFunction` property is called everytime by the GridWeb control before submitting GridWeb data to a server. Similarly, if a function is assigned to the `OnValidationErrorClientFunction` property then that function will be invoked every time a validation error occurs.

### Functions for Client-Side Scripting

Aspose.Cells.GridWeb also exposes functions especially for client-side scripting. These functions can be used within JavaScript functions to gain more control of Aspose.Cells.GridWeb. These client-side functions include the following:

{{< table style="table-striped" >}}
|Functions|Description|
|:----|:----|
|`updateData(bool cancelEdit)`|Updates all client data of Aspose.Cells.GridWeb before posting it to the server. If the `cancelEdit` parameter is true then GridWeb discards all user input.|
|`validateAll()`|Used to check if there are any validation errors in the user input. If there is an error, the function returns false, otherwise ture .|
|`submit(string arg, bool cancelEdit)`|Call this function to postback or submit data to the server. This function performs both tasks that is updating data and validating user input. This function can also fire a command event at server side. Use the `arg` parameter to pass your command. For example: the `SAVE` command is used for clicking the **Save** button on the command bar of teh GridWeb control and the `CCMD:MYCOMMAND` command fires a `CustomCommand` event.|
|`setActiveCell(int row, int column)`|Used to activate a specific cell.|
|`setCellValue(int row, int column, string value)`|Used to put a value to any cell specified using its row and column numbers.|
|`getCellValue(int row, int column)`|Returns the value of any specified cell.|
|`getActiveRow()`|Used in conjunction with the `getActiveColumn()` function to determine the position of an active cell.|
|`getActiveColumn()`|Used in conjunction with the `getActiveRow()` function to determine the position of an active cell.|
|`getSelectRange()`|Returns the last selected range.|
|`setSelectRange()`|Selects the given range.|
|`clearSelections()`|Clears all selection excluding current active cell.|
|`getCellsArray()`|It is used with other related functions like `getCellName()`, `getCellValueByCell()`, `getCellRow()` and `getCellColumn()`. Please read this article for more information regarding the usage of this function: [Read the values of the GridWeb cells on Client Side](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/developerguide/asposecellsgridweb/workingwithgridwebclientsidescript/read+the+values+of+the+gridweb+cells+on+client+side)|

To create a test application containing client-side scripts that work with Aspose.Cells.GridWeb, follow the steps below:

1.  Create JavaScript functions to be invoked by GridWeb.  
    These functions will be added to the ASP.NET page's `<script></script>` tag.
2.  Assign the names of the functions to the `OnSubmitClientFunction` and `OnValidationErrorClientFunction` properties.

The output of the code example is shown below:

**A validation added to C1 cell**  
![](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013756/5115337.png)

Add an invalid value and click **Save**. A validation error occur and the `ValidationErrorFunction` is executed.

**ValidationErrorFunction invoked on validation error**  
![](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5013756/5115335.png)

Untill you enter a valid value, no data is submitted to the server. Enter a valid value and click **Save**. The `ConfirmFunction` is executed.
