## Protecting Cells

Aspose.Cells.GridWeb provides a few different techniques for controlling the protection level on cells when the control is in [Edit mode](http://www.aspose.com/docs/display/cellsnet/Enable+Different+GridWeb+Modes#EnableDifferentGridWebModes-EditMode) (the default mode). This protects cells from being modified by end users.

### Making All Cells Read Only

To set all cells in a worksheet to read only, call the worksheet's `SetAllCellsReadonly` method.

### Making All Cells Editable

To remove protection from all cells, call the worksheet's `SetAllCellsEditable` method. This method has the opposite effect to the `SetAllCellsReadonly` method.

### Making Selected Cells Read Only

To protect only a range of cells:

1.  First make all cells editable by calling the `SetAllCellsEditable` method.
2.  Specify the range of cells that to protect by calling the worksheet's `SetReadonlyRange` method. This method takes the number of rows and columns to specify the range of cells.

### Making Selected Cells Editable

To un-protect a range of cells:

1.  Make all cells read only by calling the `SetAllCellsReadonly` method.
2.  Specify the range of cells that to be editable by calling the worksheet's `SetEditableRange` method. This method takes the number of rows and columns to specify the range of cells.
