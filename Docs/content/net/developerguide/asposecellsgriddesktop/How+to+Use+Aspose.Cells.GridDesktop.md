## Upgrade from Aspose.Grid.Desktop to Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop Control

Developers who worked with Aspose.Grid.Desktop might come across issues when using the new Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop when they upgrade to it. Following is the namespace that is renamed:

1.  **Aspose.Grid.Desktop namespace has been renamed to Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop namespace.**

## Creating & Using Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop Control

### Creating a Windows Application Project

First of all, create a windows application project in which to use the Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop control. Follow the following steps;

1.  **Open the Visual Studio.NET IDE.**
2.  **From the File menu, select New, the Project.**
3.  **Select Windows Application from the New Project dialog.**

After performing above steps a window application will be created with empty form.

### Adding `GridDesktop` Control to the Form

Drag and drop the Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop control from the Toolbox to the form. After this a control will be appeared on the form where you can perform several actions on it like **resize**, **change its properties**, **etc**.

### Run the Application

Finally, run the application by pressing **Ctrl+F5** or clicking the **Start** button. When the application runs, we see a form containing an empty Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop control. Now you can add values to cells by clicking them. Following screenshot shows how you application will finally look.

It is not only possible to add values to the control, but also to perform other tasks like changing the height of a row or the width of a column, copying (Ctrl+C) or cutting (Ctrl+X) cell data to clipboard and pasting (Ctrl+V) data to cell etc. To perform more operations, right-click the control to see its context menu.  
  

Aspose.Grid.Desktop has been renamed and become part of Aspose.Cells so it is no longer possible to use older version of Aspose.Grid.Desktop anymore. Just to emphasize, there is not much work involved in upgrading to the latest version of the Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop component. There is no change in the API as the classes with the members, structs, enumerations etc. remain the same. The only change that has been made is regarding the controlâ€™s namespace.
