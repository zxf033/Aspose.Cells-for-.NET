Aspose.Cells for .NET : Display and Hide Scroll Bars  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Display and Hide Scroll Bars


Scroll bars are useful for navigating the contents of spreadsheets that are wide and deep, that is, that have many rows and columns. Most applications support two types of scroll bar:

*   Vertical scroll bar
*   Horizontal scroll bar

Both of these are found in Microsoft Excel.

Aspose.Cell's [`GridDesktop` API](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=cellsnet&title=Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop+namespace&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=5017753) provides horizontal and vertical scroll bars for scrolling through the contents of a worksheet. With the `Aspose.Cells.GridDesktop` APIs, developers can control the visibility of both of these scroll bars.
