## Possible Usage Scenarios

Aspose.Cells allows you to save the workbook in *Strict Open XML Spreadsheet* format. For that purpose, it provides the [Workbook.Settings.Compliance](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/properties/compliance) property. If you set its value as [OoxmlCompliance.Iso29500\_2008\_Strict](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/ooxmlcompliance), then the output Excel file will be saved in Strict Open XML Spreadsheet format.

## Save Workbook to Strict Open XML Spreadsheet Format

The following sample code creates a workbook and sets the value of the [Workbook.Settings.Compliance](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/workbooksettings/properties/compliance) property as [OoxmlCompliance.Iso29500\_2008\_Strict](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/ooxmlcompliance) and saves it as [output Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/66945466/67338272.xlsx). If you open the output Excel file in Microsoft Excel and open the `Save As...` dialog box, you will see its format as *Strict Open XML Spreadsheet* as shown in this screenshot.
