## Possible Usage Scenarios

PDF/A is a unique flavor of PDF designed for the long-term preservation of documents. PDF/A is an ISO-standardized version of the Portable Document Format (PDF) which is an archival format of PDF that embeds all fonts used in the document within the PDF file. PDF/A differs from PDF by prohibiting features, such as font linking (as opposed to font embedding) and encryption. Aspose.Cells enables you to save the Excel files to PDF/A compliant PDF files `(both PdfA1a and PdfA1b are supported)`. This topic describes how to save the Excel workbook to PDF/A compliant (PdfA1a) PDF file.

Developers may use the [PdfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/pdfsaveoptions) class to set different attributes for the conversion. Setting different properties of the [PdfSaveOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/pdfsaveoptions) class gives you control over the print, font, security and compression settings for the output PDF. The most important property is [PdfSaveOptions.Compliance](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/pdfsaveoptions/properties/compliance) that enables you to save the Excel files to PDF/A compliant PDF files.
