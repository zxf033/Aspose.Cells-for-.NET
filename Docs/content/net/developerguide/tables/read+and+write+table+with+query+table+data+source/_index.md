## Read and Write Table with Query Table Data Source

With Aspose.Cells, you can read and write a table which has a QueryTable as Datasource. The support for this feature also exists for XLS files. The following code snippet demonstrates reading and writing such a table by first reading the table and then modifying it to add the totals row.
