## Possible Usage Scenarios

Microsoft Excel Watch Window is a useful tool to watch the cell values and its formulas conveniently in a window. You can open the *Watch Window* using Microsoft Excel by clicking the *Formulas > Watch*` *Window*`. It has the *Add Watch* button that can be used to add the cells for inspection. Similarly, you can use [Worksheet.CellWatches.Add()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/cells/aspose.cells/cellwatchcollection/methods/add/index) method to add cells into *Watch Window* using Aspose.Cells API.

## Add Cells to Microsoft Excel Formula Watch Window

The following sample code sets the formula of cells C1 and E1 and adds both of them to Watch Window. It then saves the workbook as [output Excel file](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/66948366/67338481.xlsx). If you open the output Excel file and view the *Watch Window*, you will see both cells as shown in this screenshot.
