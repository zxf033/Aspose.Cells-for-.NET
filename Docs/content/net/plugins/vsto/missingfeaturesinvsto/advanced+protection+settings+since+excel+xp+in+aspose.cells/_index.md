2.  Allow or restrict worksheets features or apply a password.

#### Advanced Protection Settings Using Aspose.Cells

Aspose.Cells support all of the advanced protection settings.

Aspose.Cells provides a class, [`Workbook`](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=cellsnet&title=Aspose.Cells.Workbook+class&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=5020675), that represents a Microsoft Excel file. The `Workbook` class contains a `Worksheets` collection that allows access to each worksheet in the Excel file. A worksheet is represented by the [`Worksheet`](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=cellsnet&title=Aspose.Cells.Worksheet+class&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=5020675) class.

The `Worksheet` class provides the `Protection` property that is used to apply these advanced protection settings. The `Protection` property is in fact an object of the [`Protection`](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=cellsnet&title=Aspose.Cells.Protection+class&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=5020675) class that encapsulates several Boolean properties for disabling or enabling restrictions.

Below is a small example application. It opens an Excel file and uses most of the advanced protection settings supported by Excel XP and later versions.

**C#**

{{< code lang="c#" >}}
//Creating a file stream containing the Excel file to be opened
FileStream fstream = new FileStream("book1.xls", FileMode.Open);

//Instantiating a Workbook object
//Opening the Excel file through the file stream
Workbook excel = new Workbook(fstream);

//Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file
Worksheet worksheet = excel.Worksheets[0];

//Restricting users to delete columns of the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowDeletingColumn = false;

//Restricting users to delete row of the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowDeletingRow = false;

//Restricting users to edit contents of the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowEditingContent = false;

//Restricting users to edit objects of the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowEditingObject = false;

//Restricting users to edit scenarios of the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowEditingScenario = false;

//Restricting users to filter
worksheet.Protection.AllowFiltering = false;

//Allowing users to format cells of the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowFormattingCell = true;

//Allowing users to format rows of the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowFormattingRow = true;

//Allowing users to insert columns in the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowFormattingColumn = true;

//Allowing users to insert hyperlinks in the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowInsertingHyperlink = true;

//Allowing users to insert rows in the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowInsertingRow = true;

//Allowing users to select locked cells of the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowSelectingLockedCell = true;

//Allowing users to select unlocked cells of the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowSelectingUnlockedCell = true;

//Allowing users to sort
worksheet.Protection.AllowSorting = true;

//Allowing users to use pivot tables in the worksheet
worksheet.Protection.AllowUsingPivotTable = true;

//Saving the modified Excel file
excel.Save("output.xls", SaveFormat.Excel97To2003);

//Closing the file stream to free all resources
fstream.Close();
