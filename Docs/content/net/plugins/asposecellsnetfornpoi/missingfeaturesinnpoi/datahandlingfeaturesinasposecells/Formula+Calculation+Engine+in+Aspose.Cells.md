# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Formula Calculation Engine in Aspose.Cells


## Aspose.Cells - Formula Calculation Engine

The formula calculation engine is embedded in Aspose.Cells. It can not only re-calculate the formula imported from a designer spreadsheet file but also supports to calculate the results of formulas added at runtime.

**C#**

//Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook book = new Workbook();

//Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet
int sheetIndex = book.Worksheets.Add();
Worksheet worksheet = book.Worksheets[sheetIndex];
Cells cells = worksheet.Cells;
Cell cell = null;

//Adding a value to "A1" cell
cell = cells["A1"];
cell.Value = 1;

//Adding a value to "A2" cell
cell = cells["A2"];
cell.Value = 2;

//Adding a value to "A3" cell
cell = cells["A3"];
cell.Value = 3;

//Adding a SUM formula to "A4" cell
cell = cells["A4"];
cell.Formula = "=SUM(A1:A3)";

//Calculating the results of formulas
book.CalculateFormula();

//Saving the Excel file
book.Save("AsposeFormulaEngine.xls");
