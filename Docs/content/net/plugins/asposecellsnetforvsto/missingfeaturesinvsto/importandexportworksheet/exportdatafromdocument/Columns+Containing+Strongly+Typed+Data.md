Aspose.Cells for .NET : Columns Containing Strongly Typed Data  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Columns Containing Strongly Typed Data


We know that a spreadsheet stores data as a sequence of rows and columns. If all values in the columns of a worksheet are strongly typed (that means all values in a column must have the same data type) then we can export the worksheet content by calling the **ExportDataTable** method of the Cells class. **ExportDataTable** method takes the following parameters to export worksheet data as **DataTable** object: **Row Number** , represents the row number of the first cell from where the data will be exported

*   **Column Number** , represents the column number of the first cell from where the data will be exported
*   **Number of Rows** , represents the number of rows to export
*   **Number of Columns** , represents the number of columns to export
*   **Export Column Names** , a boolean proeprty that indicates whether the data in the first row of the worksheet should be exported as column names of the DataTable or not

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//Creating a file stream containing the Excel file to be opened
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(FOD_OpenFile.FileName, FileMode.Open);

//Instantiating a Workbook object
//Opening the Excel file through the file stream
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);

//Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Exporting the contents of 2 rows and 2 columns starting from 1st cell to DataTable
DataTable dataTable = worksheet.Cells.ExportDataTable(0, 0,2, 2, true);

//Binding the DataTable with DataGrid

dataGridView1.DataSource = dataTable;

//Closing the file stream to free all resources
fstream.Close();
