# What is VSTO?

VSTO, or Visual Studio Tools for Office, or Microsoft Visual Studio Tools is part of Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET tools suite and supports the Microsoft .NET Framework. It is used by developers to write code connecting Microsoft Office Word, Excel and Outlook applications. Developers using VSTO can employ C# or Visual Basic languages. It is an alternative to Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA.

# Aspose.Cells for .Net

Aspose.Cells for .NET provides the most flexible group of components that enable .NET Application to create and manage Excel Spreadsheets without requiring Microsoft Excel to be installed on the server. Aspose.Cells is one of the leading components for all types of Excel formats manipulation. Unlike similar products from other vendors, Aspose.Cells not only supports spreadsheet generation and other basic file formatting features, but also supports a number of advanced features. These advanced features make it much more convenient for the developers to manipulate spreadsheet contents, cells formatting and files protection. Aspose.Cells also allows importing data into spreadsheets from different data sources, adding common and complex Mathematical, DateTime, Financial, Text Formulas / Functions, supports manipulation of charts, pictures, comments, drawing objects and controls etc.

# Aspose.Cells for VSTO

## Introduction

The developers looking for file format libraries may need to walk through the features provided by the libraries available on the market. Mainly, two factors are considered when choosing an option:

*   Features
*   Efforts required to use the library

If you are a .NET developer looking for faster,easy and light-weight file format library to process files, you may need to compare VSTO(Visual Studio tool for Office) with Aspose. In this case, this project will help you to compare features and code in both libraries.
