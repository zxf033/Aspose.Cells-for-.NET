# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Assemble Spreadsheets


This section describes how to:

Create a new Excel file from scratch and add worksheet to it.

*   Add worksheets to designer spreadsheets.
*   Access worksheets using the sheet name.
*   Remove a worksheet from an Excel file using its sheet name.
*   Remove a worksheet from an Excel file using its sheet index.
*   Aspose.Cells provides a class, Workbook that represents an Excel file. The Workbook class contains a Worksheets collection that allows to access to each worksheet in the Excel file.

A worksheet is represented by the Worksheet class. The Worksheet class provides a wide range of properties and methods for managing worksheets.

## Adding Worksheets to a New Excel File

To create a new Excel file programmatically:

*   Create an object of the Workbook class.
*   Call the Add method of the Worksheets collection. An empty worksheet is added to the Excel file \* automatically. It can be referenced by passing the sheet index of the new worksheet to the Worksheets collection.
*   Obtain a worksheet reference.
*   Perform work on the worksheets.
*   Save the new Excel file with new worksheets by calling the Workbook class' Save method.

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//Adding a new worksheet to the Workbook object
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();

//Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];

//Setting the name of the newly added worksheet
worksheet.Name = "My Worksheet";

//Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save("Adding Worksheet.xls");
{{< /code >}}

## Adding Worksheets to a Designer Spreadsheet

The process of adding worksheets to a designer spreadsheet is the same as that of adding a new worksheet, except that the Excel file already exists so should be opened before worksheets are added. A designer spreadsheet can be opened by the Workbook class.

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//Creating a file stream containing the Excel file to be opened
FileStream fstream = new FileStream("book1.xls", FileMode.Open);

//Instantiating a Workbook object
//Opening the Excel file through the file stream
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);

//Adding a new worksheet to the Workbook object
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();

//Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];

//Setting the name of the newly added worksheet
worksheet.Name = "My Worksheet";

//Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save("Designer Spreadsheet.xls");

//Closing the file stream to free all resources
fstream.Close();
{{< /code >}}

## Accessing Worksheets using Sheet Name

Access or get any worksheet by specifying its name or index.

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//Creating a file stream containing the Excel file to be opened
FileStream fstream = new FileStream("WorksHeet Operations.xls", FileMode.Open);

//Instantiating a Workbook object
//Opening the Excel file through the file stream
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);

//Accessing a worksheet using its sheet name
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets["Sheet1"];
{{< /code >}}

## Removing Worksheets using Sheet Name

To remove worksheets from a file, call the Worksheets collection' RemoveAt method. Pass the sheet name to the RemoveAt method to remove a specific worksheet.

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//Creating a file stream containing the Excel file to be opened
FileStream fstream = new FileStream("WorksHeet Operations.xls", FileMode.Open);

//Instantiating a Workbook object
//Opening the Excel file through the file stream
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);

//Removing a worksheet using its sheet name
workbook.Worksheets.RemoveAt("Sheet3");
workbook.Save("WorksHeet Operations.xls");
{{< /code >}}

## Removing Worksheets using Sheet Index

Removing worksheets by name works well when the name of the worksheet is known. If you don't know the worksheet's name, use an overloaded version of the RemoveAt method that takes the sheet index of the worksheet instead of its sheet name.

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//creating a file stream containing the Excel file to be opened
FileStream fstream = new FileStream("WorksHeet Operations.xls", FileMode.Open);

//Instantiating a Workbook object
//Opening the Excel file through the file stream
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);

//Removing a worksheet using its sheet index
workbook.Worksheets.RemoveAt(1);
workbook.Save("WorksHeet Operations.xls");
{{< /code >}}
