# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Import Export data from document


# Import data from document

Data is the collection of raw facts and we create spreadsheet documents or reports to present these raw facts in a more meaningful manner. Normally, we add data to spreadsheets by ourselves but sometimes, we need to reuse existing data resources and here comes the need to import data to spreadsheets from different data sources. In this topic, we will discuss some techniques to import data to worksheets from different data sources.

## Importing Data Using Aspose.Cells

When you use **Aspose.Cells** to open an Excel file, all data in the file is automatically imported but Aspose.Cells also supports to import data from different data sources. A few of these data sources are listed below:

*   **Array**
*   **ArrayList**
*   **DataTable**
*   **DataColumn**
*   **DataView**
*   **DataGrid**
*   **DataReader**
*   **GridView**

Aspose.Cells provides a class, **Workbook** that represents an Excel file. Workbook class contains a Worksheets collection that allows to access each worksheet in the Excel file. A worksheet is represented by the Worksheet class. Worksheet class provides a Cells collection.

Cells collection provides very useful methods to import data from different data sources.

### Importing from Array

Developers can import data from an array to their worksheets by calling the **ImportArray** method of the Cells collection. There are many overloaded versions of the ImportArray method but a typical overload takes the following parameters:

*   Array, represents the array object whose contents need to import
*   Row Number, represents the row number of the first cell where the data will be imported
*   Column Number, represents the column number of the first cell where the data will be imported
*   Is Vertical, a boolean value that specifies to import data vertically or horizontally

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//Adding a new worksheet to the Workbook object
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();

//Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];

//Creating an array containing names as string values
string[] names = new string[] { "laurence chen", "roman korchagin", "kyle huang" };

//Importing the array of names to 1st row and first column vertically
worksheet.Cells.ImportArray(names, 0, 0, true);

//Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(MyDir+"DataImport from Array.xls");
{{< /code >}}

### Importing from ArrayList

Developers can import data from an ArrayList to their worksheets by calling the **ImportArrayList** method of the Cells collection. ImportArray method takes the following parameters: **ArrayList** , represents the ArrayList object whose contents need to import

*   Row Number , represents the row number of the first cell where the data will be imported
*   Column Number , represents the column number of the first cell where the data will be imported
*   Is Vertical , a boolean value that specifies to import data vertically or horizontally

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//Adding a new worksheet to the Workbook object
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();

//Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];
//Instantiating an ArrayList object
ArrayList list = new ArrayList();

//Add few names to the list as string values
list.Add("laurence chen");
list.Add("roman korchagin");
list.Add("kyle huang");
list.Add("tommy wang");

//Importing the contents of ArrayList to 1st row and first column vertically
worksheet.Cells.ImportArrayList(list, 0, 0, true);

//Saving the Excel file
workbook.Save(MyDir + "DataImport from Array List.xls");

{{< /code >}}

### Importing from Custom Objects

Developers can import data from collection of objects to a worksheet using **ImportCustomObjects**. You can provide a list of columns/properties to the method to display your desired list of objects.

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//Instantiate a new Workbook
Workbook book = new Workbook();
//Clear all the worksheets
book.Worksheets.Clear();
//Add a new Sheet "Data";
Worksheet sheet = book.Worksheets.Add("Data");

//Define List

List<WeeklyItem> list = new List<WeeklyItem>();
//Add data to the list of objects
list.Add(new WeeklyItem() { AtYarnStage = 1, InWIPStage = 2, Payment = 3, Shipment = 4, Shipment2 = 5 });
list.Add(new WeeklyItem() { AtYarnStage = 5, InWIPStage = 9, Payment = 7, Shipment = 2, Shipment2 = 5 });
list.Add(new WeeklyItem() { AtYarnStage = 7, InWIPStage = 3, Payment = 3, Shipment = 8, Shipment2 = 3 });

//We pick a few columns not all to import to the worksheet
sheet.Cells.ImportCustomObjects((System.Collections.ICollection)list,
new string[] { "Date", "InWIPStage", "Shipment", "Payment" },
true,
0,
0,
list.Count,
true,
"dd/mm/yyyy",
false);

//Auto-fit all the columns
book.Worksheets[0].AutoFitColumns();
//Save the Excel file
book.Save(MyDir+"ImportedCustomObjects.xls");
{{< /code >}}

### Importing from DataTable

Developers can import data from a **DataTable** to their worksheets by calling the **ImportDataTable** method of the Cells collection. There are many overloaded versions of the **ImportDataTable** method but a typical overload takes the following parameters:**DataTable** , represents the **DataTable** object whose contents need to import

*   **Is Field Name Shown**, specifies that whether the names of the columns of DataTable should be imported to worksheet as a first row or not
*   **Start Cell** , represents the name of the start cell (i.e. "A1") from where to import the contents of the DataTable

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//Instantiating a Workbook object
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();

//Adding a new worksheet to the Workbook object
int i = workbook.Worksheets.Add();

//Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[i];
//Instantiating a "Products" DataTable object
DataTable dataTable = new DataTable("Products");

//Adding columns to the DataTable object
dataTable.Columns.Add("Product ID", typeof(Int32));
dataTable.Columns.Add("Product Name", typeof(string));
dataTable.Columns.Add("Units In Stock", typeof(Int32));

//Creating an empty row in the DataTable object
DataRow dr = dataTable.NewRow();

//Adding data to the row
dr[0] = 1;
dr[1] = "Aniseed Syrup";
dr[2] = 15;

//Adding filled row to the DataTable object
dataTable.Rows.Add(dr);

//Creating another empty row in the DataTable object
dr = dataTable.NewRow();

//Adding data to the row
dr[0] = 2;
dr[1] = "Boston Crab Meat";
dr[2] = 123;

//Adding filled row to the DataTable object
dataTable.Rows.Add(dr);

//Importing the contents of DataTable to the worksheet starting from "A1" cell,
//where true specifies that the column names of the DataTable would be added to
//the worksheet as a header row
worksheet.Cells.ImportDataTable(dataTable, true, "A1");
workbook.Save(MyDir+"Import From Data Table.xls");

# Export data from document

Aspose.Cells not only facilitates its users to import data to worksheets from external data sources but also allow them to export their worksheet data to a **DataTable**. As we know that **DataTable** is the part of ADO.NET and is used to hold data. Once the data is stored in a **DataTable**, it can be used in any way according to the requirements of users.

## Exporting Data to DataTable (.NET) Using Aspose.Cells

Developers can easily export their worksheet data to a DataTable object by calling either ExportDataTable or ExportDataTableAsString method of the Cells class. Both methods are used in different scenarios, which are discussed below in more detail.

### Columns Containing Strongly Typed Data

We know that a spreadsheet stores data as a sequence of rows and columns. If all values in the columns of a worksheet are strongly typed (that means all values in a column must have the same data type) then we can export the worksheet content by calling the **ExportDataTable** method of the Cells class. **ExportDataTable** method takes the following parameters to export worksheet data as **DataTable** object: **Row Number** , represents the row number of the first cell from where the data will be exported

*   **Column Number** , represents the column number of the first cell from where the data will be exported
*   **Number of Rows** , represents the number of rows to export
*   **Number of Columns** , represents the number of columns to export
*   **Export Column Names** , a boolean proeprty that indicates whether the data in the first row of the worksheet should be exported as column names of the DataTable or not

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//Creating a file stream containing the Excel file to be opened
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(FOD_OpenFile.FileName, FileMode.Open);

//Instantiating a Workbook object
//Opening the Excel file through the file stream
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);

//Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Exporting the contents of 2 rows and 2 columns starting from 1st cell to DataTable
DataTable dataTable = worksheet.Cells.ExportDataTable(0, 0,2, 2, true);

//Binding the DataTable with DataGrid

dataGridView1.DataSource = dataTable;

//Closing the file stream to free all resources
fstream.Close();
{{< /code >}}

### Columns Containing Non-Strongly Typed Data

If all values in the columns of a worksheet are not strongly typed (that means the values in a column may have the different data types) then we can export the worksheet content by calling the **ExportDataTableAsString** method of the Cells class. **ExportDataTableAsString** method takes the same set of parameters as that of **ExportDataTable** method to export worksheet data as **DataTable** object.

{{< code lang="cs" >}}
//Creating a file stream containing the Excel file to be opened
FileStream fstream = new FileStream(FOD_OpenFile.FileName, FileMode.Open);

//Instantiating a Workbook object
//Opening the Excel file through the file stream
Workbook workbook = new Workbook(fstream);

//Accessing the first worksheet in the Excel file
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

//Exporting the contents of 2 rows and 2 columns starting from 1st cell to DataTable
DataTable dataTable = worksheet.Cells.ExportDataTableAsString(0, 0, 2, 2, true);

//Binding the DataTable with DataGrid
dataGridView2.DataSource = dataTable;

//Closing the file stream to free all resources
fstream.Close();
