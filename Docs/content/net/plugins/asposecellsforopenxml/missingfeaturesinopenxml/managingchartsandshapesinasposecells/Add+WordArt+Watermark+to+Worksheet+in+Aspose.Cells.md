Aspose.Cells for .NET : Add WordArt Watermark to Worksheet in Aspose.Cells  

# Aspose.Cells for .NET : Add WordArt Watermark to Worksheet in Aspose.Cells


Use WordArt to add special text effects to spreadsheets. For example, stretch a title across the top of the file, decorate text, and make text fit a preset shape, or apply text to an Excel sheet as a background watermark. The WordArt becomes an object that you can move or position in spreadsheets to add decoration.

  

The following example shows how to add a WordArt shape to set a background watermark for a worksheet.

After running the code the output file contains a pale red WordArt watermark.
