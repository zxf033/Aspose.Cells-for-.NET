This page contains release notes for [Aspose.Grid .Net 1.5.0.0 New Release](http://www.aspose.com/downloads/cells/net/new-releases/aspose.grid-.net-1.5.0.0-new-release/)

Dear Customers,

We have release Aspose.Grid v1.5!

Aspose.Grid  
is your total grid solution. Aspose.Grid comes packaged with two different GUI .NET components: one to support desktop applications(Aspose.Grid.Desktop  
) and another to support web applications(Aspose.Grid.Web  
). Both versions are equally matched in order to make implementing in either platform a snap. Aspose.Grid provides the ability to import from and export to ExcelÂ® spreadsheets. Doing so means that anyone familiar with Excel (even end-users) can design the look and feel of a grid. Aspose.Grid also offers an easy to use, feature-rich API which provides developers with complete control over the look, feel and behavior of their grid. And most importantly Aspose.Grid is priced to suit your budget. Nowhere else will you find a component as feature-rich, easy to use and as well priced as Aspose.Grid.
