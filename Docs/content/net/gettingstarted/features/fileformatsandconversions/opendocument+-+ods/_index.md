## About OpenDocument

The [OpenDocument format (ODF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) is a free and open file format for electronic office documents originally developed by Sun for the Open Office suite. OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS) is the file format for Excel documents. OpenDocument is currently an OASIS and ISO standard.

## ODS in Aspose.Cells

Aspose.Cells supports loading OpenDocument 1.1 and 1.2 documents. Aspose.Cells saves documents in the OpenDocument 1.1 format. You can also see the [detailed specification](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/gettingstarted/features/documentsupported/save+in+the+ods+-+opendocument+spreadsheet+format) about what OpenDocument features are supported.
