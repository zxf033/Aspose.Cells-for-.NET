## About XPS

![](https://docs2.aspose.com/cells/net/attachments/5018340/5114740.png)

The [XML Paper Specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Paper_Specification) is a page description language and a fixed-document format originally developed by Microsoft. Like PDF, XPS is a fixed-layout document format designed to preserve document fidelity and provide device-independent document appearance.

## XPS in Aspose.Cells

Any document loaded into Aspose.Cells can be converted to XPS. Aspose.Cells uses the same high-fidelity page layout and rendering engine to produce output in all its supported fixed-layout formats e.g PDF, XPS etc.

It is worthwhile to note that Aspose.Cells generates XPS directly (including sub-setting of TrueType fonts), without relying on the Windows Presentation Foundation classes found in the .NET Framework 3.5, this allows Aspose.Cells to produce XPS on machines that run .NET of earlier versions or on completely different platforms.
