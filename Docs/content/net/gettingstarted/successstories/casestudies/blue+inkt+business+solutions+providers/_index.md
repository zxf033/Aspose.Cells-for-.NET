## Product Background

Blue Inkt is a Dutch company that develops web based software that can be applied to almost every business station and fitting any level of company's day-to-day business world wide. We provide a number of web based software applications, but the core business for us is TeleManager, Leadmanager and upcoming MarketingManager.

## Requirements Scenario

A few of our customers that use our software asked frequently for a solution for making export from LeadManager to Microsoft Excel. They use it to make an export by using the print screen button but the way it worked now wasn't efficient enough so we needed a solution for this issue. Another option was that we made an export from the database but this cost too much time because the data also contained a lot of data you did not need.

## Solution Implementation

We started looking for the right solution to solve this problem. After a few clicks on the website Google we saw that Aspose has a solution we needed. We tried the 30 days promo and were really excited about it. We build an extra button in our applications to make exports to Excel.

The result of this test was very good. If you have, for example 100 requests for an export that each takes 10 minutes. You don't have to be an expert to realize this really was the solution we needed.

## Conclusion

Now we have solved the issue that was causing our clients too much time. The usability of our products is higher.
